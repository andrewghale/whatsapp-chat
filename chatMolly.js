12/10/2019, 00:41 - Molly: Which one??
12/10/2019, 00:42 - Andrew: Tristana
12/10/2019, 00:42 - Andrew: the mega long one
12/10/2019, 00:43 - Molly: Perfect night time listening
12/10/2019, 00:46 - Andrew: but then I put on some pretentious electronic stuff ;)
12/10/2019, 00:48 - Molly: Damnit. You were doing so well
12/10/2019, 00:51 - Andrew: time to sleep now anyway, way past my bedtime üò¨ hah
12/10/2019, 00:51 - Andrew: looking forward to sunday and I will message you tomorrow :)
12/10/2019, 00:54 - Molly: Great, talk tomorrow. Sleep well
12/10/2019, 10:49 - Andrew: I think a cigarette last night would have made my headache worse this morning üò¨
12/10/2019, 10:56 - Molly: Oh no, do you have a headache?
12/10/2019, 10:59 - Andrew: Well it was pretty minor
12/10/2019, 10:59 - Andrew: My alcohol tolerance isn't what it used to be
12/10/2019, 11:00 - Molly: Same, but I slept really well. I should drink more often
12/10/2019, 11:01 - Molly: Also I make the best hangover food
12/10/2019, 11:04 - Andrew: Mmm I do fancy a big breakfast
12/10/2019, 11:05 - Molly: It's the gotta be the greasiest
12/10/2019, 11:06 - Andrew: I'm about to go into town though, might have to resort to Greggs instead
12/10/2019, 11:07 - Molly: Nothing wrong with Greggs
12/10/2019, 11:27 - Andrew: (I secretly love it)
12/10/2019, 11:28 - Andrew: Excellent news that we are on the same wavelength about Greggs :)
12/10/2019, 11:35 - Molly: They make the best chicken slice
12/10/2019, 11:35 - Molly: üòé
12/10/2019, 11:49 - Andrew: it's so bad for the planet but it tastes so good
12/10/2019, 11:51 - Molly: I think the original Gregg who started the company is a criminal too. They're not doing too well
12/10/2019, 11:52 - Andrew: you're right, it is criminal how tasty it is
12/10/2019, 11:52 - Molly: Good save
12/10/2019, 12:04 - Andrew: Up to much today?
12/10/2019, 12:06 - Andrew: I'm about to watch Joker with a friend
12/10/2019, 12:06 - Andrew: I've been told it's pretty grim and brutal üåà
12/10/2019, 12:08 - Molly: Tbh I've only seen one batman film, and I didn't like it. Is the Joker just about the joker?
12/10/2019, 12:10 - Andrew: I think so, I'm going based on recommendation though, I'm not really a fan of comic book films either
12/10/2019, 12:10 - Andrew: There are just toooo many of them and they're usually crap
12/10/2019, 12:17 - Molly: I agree!
12/10/2019, 15:41 - Andrew: Ok that film was brutal
12/10/2019, 15:48 - Molly: In a good way?
12/10/2019, 15:52 - Andrew: yeah, it was surprisingly good for a hollywood kind of film
12/10/2019, 15:53 - Andrew: nothing like a typical comic book film either
12/10/2019, 15:53 - Molly: Huh. Okay. Maybe I'll go see it
12/10/2019, 15:54 - Andrew: it's excruciatingly awkward in a few parts
12/10/2019, 15:54 - Andrew: so much so that I was writhing in my seat
12/10/2019, 15:54 - Molly: Ew that sounds bad. I heard it was mostly aimed at lonely guys
12/10/2019, 16:14 - Andrew: the film itself?
12/10/2019, 16:15 - Andrew: well the main character has a pretty terrible life and kills people and causes riots across the city
12/10/2019, 16:15 - Andrew: good wholesome fun
12/10/2019, 16:15 - Molly: Yeah, wasn't there that thing about incels idolising the joker
12/10/2019, 16:15 - Molly: Oh good
12/10/2019, 16:15 - Andrew: oh yeah!
12/10/2019, 16:16 - Molly: I feel like we're just waiting for someone to go on a creepy incel murder spree
12/10/2019, 16:16 - Andrew: the crowd seemed pretty normal today in the cinema :)
12/10/2019, 16:16 - Molly: No shifty looking single guys?
12/10/2019, 16:17 - Andrew: theres many of them in bristol centre haha
12/10/2019, 16:18 - Andrew: i would recommend the film though, even if you don't like comic book films
12/10/2019, 16:19 - Molly: Okay I just read a really worrying article about it. I'll watch the film from the safety of my home, I think
12/10/2019, 16:20 - Molly: I was literally just in town. Didn't know it got so busy on a Saturday! Were you at the Odeon?
12/10/2019, 16:50 - Andrew: Yeah the one in Broadmead
12/10/2019, 16:51 - Andrew: now I've had a few drinks with a mate so I can't really work at the moment üò¨
12/10/2019, 16:59 - Molly: That's a pretty good excuse to take the evening off
12/10/2019, 17:05 - Andrew: you know what... I think I might do just that
12/10/2019, 17:11 - Molly: Rebellion!
12/10/2019, 17:25 - Andrew: might do a quick 2 hours actually, I'm not the rebellious type haha
12/10/2019, 17:25 - Andrew: what are you doing this evening?
12/10/2019, 17:26 - Molly: Nothing. I might go to the gym if I can find the energy, but I also might just order pizza and watch tv
12/10/2019, 17:36 - Andrew: ooh Saturday night on the treadmill :p
12/10/2019, 17:36 - Molly: Okay that makes me sound so lame
12/10/2019, 17:36 - Molly: Well, what do you suggest?
12/10/2019, 17:38 - Andrew: saturday night on a treadmill with a lambrini and a pack of cigarettes?
12/10/2019, 17:39 - Molly: Oh nice. They'll cancel each other out
12/10/2019, 17:39 - Andrew: uh oh, now i want a cigarette...
12/10/2019, 17:39 - Molly: You're killing me
12/10/2019, 17:44 - Andrew: maybe we're both enablers ü§î
12/10/2019, 17:45 - Andrew: maybe we'll be smoking a pack a day soon :P
12/10/2019, 17:45 - Molly: No! This is bad!
12/10/2019, 17:45 - Molly: We can enable each other to be healthy
12/10/2019, 17:46 - Molly: Now, tell me, which pizza place is the best?
12/10/2019, 17:46 - Andrew: "No. 51" on Stokes Croft
12/10/2019, 17:46 - Andrew: everytime
12/10/2019, 17:47 - Molly: Okay that looks pretty good
12/10/2019, 17:48 - Andrew: so I take it you aren't going to the gym then?
12/10/2019, 17:48 - Andrew: if you're ordering pizza first
12/10/2019, 17:48 - Molly: I haven't decided...
12/10/2019, 17:48 - Molly: Or maybe I have, but I'm in denial
12/10/2019, 17:52 - Andrew: give in to your desires
12/10/2019, 17:52 - Andrew: sweet greasy doughy desires
12/10/2019, 17:52 - Molly: You're a bad influence
12/10/2019, 17:53 - Andrew: üòè
12/10/2019, 17:53 - Molly: Are you going to cycle about tonight then?
12/10/2019, 18:05 - Andrew: ok, I've decided, I won't work tonight :D
12/10/2019, 18:05 - Andrew: feels good to be able to chose when to work
12/10/2019, 18:05 - Andrew: I don't feel like staying at home though, do you fancy doing something tonight?
12/10/2019, 18:09 - Molly: Yes. Finally! I thought you'd never ask
12/10/2019, 18:12 - Andrew: pizza then? :p
12/10/2019, 18:13 - Molly: Sounds good to me
12/10/2019, 18:13 - Molly: Where?
12/10/2019, 18:14 - Andrew: where from?
12/10/2019, 18:14 - Molly: Like do you wanna go out and have pizza, or stay in?
12/10/2019, 18:16 - Andrew: lets stay in and deliveroo it :)

14/10/2019, 08:49 - Molly: Let me know if you hear about your new job today. I'll be sending good vibes ü§ûü§ûü§û
14/10/2019, 11:36 - Andrew: aw thanks :)
14/10/2019, 11:36 - Andrew: no reply yet though
14/10/2019, 11:36 - Andrew: I slept pretty solidly for about 9 hours
14/10/2019, 11:38 - Molly: That's good. You feeling well rested?
14/10/2019, 11:38 - Andrew: totally, many calories were burned yesterday ;)
14/10/2019, 11:39 - Andrew: although much more were eaten
14/10/2019, 11:42 - Molly: I dunno. My muscles are killing me today. I'm counting yesterday as exercise
14/10/2019, 11:43 - Andrew: yeah me too
14/10/2019, 11:43 - Andrew: very healthy of us
14/10/2019, 11:44 - Molly: You're still coming over one evening, right? I'm going Asda to grab ingredients
14/10/2019, 11:45 - Andrew: yeah for sure :)
14/10/2019, 11:46 - Molly: Perfect. Pasta and banana bread. Lots of carbs üòç
14/10/2019, 11:54 - Andrew: üòªüòªüòª
14/10/2019, 11:57 - Andrew: we said thursday didn't we? wednesday would be equally fine for me, so whichever day works best for you
14/10/2019, 12:36 - Molly: Are you not doing something for your birthday?
14/10/2019, 12:47 - Andrew: well me and a few mates might be going to a buffet one night this week for my birthday, and then the simple things festival on the weekend
14/10/2019, 12:47 - Andrew: but nothing specifically planned for my actual birthday day
14/10/2019, 12:51 - Andrew: I would be more than happy to be treated to some banana bread at yours on my birthday :)
14/10/2019, 12:52 - Molly: Thursday is easier for me as I don't have work Friday, if you wanna drink and stay late. But I can do Wednesday if that works better for you. You are definitely not doing nothing on Wednesday either way, I won't allow it xx
14/10/2019, 13:00 - Andrew: well I would quite like a drink, so thursday night it is xx
14/10/2019, 13:07 - Molly: Are you busy Friday morning as well?
14/10/2019, 13:08 - Andrew: nah, nothing planned for friday other than possibly evening deliveroo
14/10/2019, 13:08 - Molly: Great. Then you can stay the night ‚ò∫Ô∏è
14/10/2019, 13:10 - Andrew: brilliant, looking forward to it :)
14/10/2019, 13:12 - Andrew: it's my turn to bring the wine thenüç∑
14/10/2019, 13:18 - Molly: I don't recommend the polish shop üòâ
14/10/2019, 13:34 - Andrew: because they don't sell cigarettes? :P
14/10/2019, 14:04 - Molly: It was probably good they didn't sell cigarettes. But they only had one kind of wine and it was a little overpriced
14/10/2019, 14:04 - Molly: Go Lidl. Way better wine üòä
14/10/2019, 14:34 - Andrew: we must be relatively healthy on thursday night so i'm not going to buy cigarettes
14/10/2019, 14:34 - Andrew: well, i'll try not to...
14/10/2019, 14:40 - Molly: You have better will power than me then
14/10/2019, 16:26 - Andrew: i'm not sure about that, i'm round my mates house and I managed to convince him to get a deliveroo
14/10/2019, 16:26 - Andrew: i've almost exclusively had restaurant food for the last 2 daysüò¨
14/10/2019, 16:33 - Molly: Okay that's pretty bad
14/10/2019, 16:50 - Molly: What are you getting tho
14/10/2019, 16:55 - Andrew: well kfc and pizza
14/10/2019, 16:55 - Andrew: and then early on saturday i had burger and fries and 3 beers
14/10/2019, 16:55 - Andrew: and then a big cooked breakfast for most days last week
14/10/2019, 16:56 - Andrew: I am usually healthier though I promise!
14/10/2019, 17:00 - Molly: You sound like you should be a lot fatter than you are. It's not fair
14/10/2019, 18:43 - Andrew: well I am putting on weight
14/10/2019, 18:43 - Andrew: and I've been skinny for a long time but now I cycle less and I'm about to get a 9 to 5
14/10/2019, 18:44 - Andrew: i will be super big by the time I'm  30 :p
14/10/2019, 18:47 - Molly: You'd be cute chubby üòç
14/10/2019, 18:47 - Molly: Maybe we should do some more active dates
14/10/2019, 19:08 - Andrew: I won't get chubby I'm sure of that
14/10/2019, 19:08 - Andrew: a bit more running or cycling or fasting would keep me at a decent weight üí™üèª
14/10/2019, 19:08 - Andrew: üí™üèº*
14/10/2019, 19:09 - Andrew: my correct skin colour
14/10/2019, 19:26 - Molly: Didn't know could do that
14/10/2019, 19:26 - Molly: üëª <-- me
14/10/2019, 19:35 - Andrew: i think pale is better remember ;)
14/10/2019, 19:36 - Molly: Would you still like me if I was super chubby ghost
14/10/2019, 19:37 - Andrew: look, you're not chubby!
14/10/2019, 19:37 - Andrew: even though you said you were, you arent! :p
14/10/2019, 19:37 - Molly: Okay fine but if I was
14/10/2019, 19:38 - Andrew: chubby ghost is actually a fetish of mine
14/10/2019, 19:38 - Molly: Good
14/10/2019, 19:38 - Molly: It's my specialty
14/10/2019, 19:39 - Molly: Would you still like me if I had no limbs
14/10/2019, 19:41 - Andrew: you mean a torso and a head
14/10/2019, 19:41 - Molly: Yes exactly
14/10/2019, 19:42 - Andrew: of course i would
14/10/2019, 19:42 - Andrew: i could carry you around on my front
14/10/2019, 19:42 - Andrew: ive got a great joke about having no limbs but it's too long
14/10/2019, 19:43 - Andrew: remind me to tell you on thursday
14/10/2019, 19:43 - Molly: That's the cutest!
14/10/2019, 19:43 - Molly: Okay I actually wanna hear that
14/10/2019, 19:44 - Andrew: are you planning on going limbless btw
14/10/2019, 19:45 - Andrew: i gues it's a good way to save money on clothes
14/10/2019, 19:45 - Molly: Maybe I am
14/10/2019, 19:45 - Molly: Maybe I'm just testing you
14/10/2019, 19:45 - Molly: How would that save money tho
14/10/2019, 19:45 - Andrew: you could wear just a pillow case
14/10/2019, 19:47 - Molly: I mean, I could probably do that now
14/10/2019, 19:48 - Andrew: i think my funky indian style pillowcases would really suit you
14/10/2019, 19:48 - Molly: I actually really like your bedding. I would definitely wear that
14/10/2019, 19:59 - Andrew: well I've decided I'm going to go back to my old cotton sheets
14/10/2019, 19:59 - Andrew: based on your recommendation
14/10/2019, 20:00 - Molly: Oh I feel bad now. Don't listen to me, I know nothing
14/10/2019, 20:01 - Andrew: but the rest of the bedding I'm still keeping :p
14/10/2019, 20:01 - Andrew: so you will have to come to mine again to enjoy it :)
14/10/2019, 20:03 - Molly: Very tempting
14/10/2019, 20:03 - Molly: Even if I have no arms or legs
14/10/2019, 21:26 - Andrew: back home and dry and showered after deliverooing

15/10/2019, 09:47 - Molly: You'll hear soon. I'm sure of it
15/10/2019, 09:47 - Molly: What are you doing today?
15/10/2019, 10:45 - Andrew: well, i've done a few things already
15/10/2019, 10:45 - Andrew: went to asda, picked up some new meds and collected a super cheap massive breakfast
15/10/2019, 10:46 - Andrew: think i will put a few new job applications in, just in case, and work on my website a bit more
15/10/2019, 10:47 - Andrew: but since I had a massive breakfast, I must go for a run later :P
15/10/2019, 10:55 - Molly: Wow super productive!
15/10/2019, 10:55 - Andrew: kind of :P
15/10/2019, 10:55 - Molly: Wish I could work evenings. I'd get so much stuff done
15/10/2019, 10:55 - Andrew: it's stuff that feels a bit productive, but not THAT productive
15/10/2019, 10:56 - Molly: I dunno. It sounds like you're pretty busy
15/10/2019, 11:01 - Andrew: well tomorrow I definitely won't be :)

15/10/2019, 11:05 - Molly: Half of that is exercise!! Why?!
15/10/2019, 11:06 - Andrew: exercise is fun!
15/10/2019, 11:06 - Molly: Aawh you're a sweetie. You should probably lower your expectations. I cannot cook
15/10/2019, 11:07 - Andrew: you totally can
15/10/2019, 11:07 - Andrew: i believe in you!
15/10/2019, 11:09 - Molly: Thanks üòä if it's bad, you can just pretend it's good, right?

15/10/2019, 16:51 - Molly: Are you there?
15/10/2019, 16:52 - Andrew: nah i'm at home, but I was going through old photos I had sent to my sister
15/10/2019, 17:03 - Andrew: (Media Omitted)
15/10/2019, 17:03 - Andrew: the one time i saw foxes

15/10/2019, 17:09 - Molly: üòÆ that's amazing!!
15/10/2019, 17:39 - Andrew: the cat wasn't very impressed
15/10/2019, 17:48 - Molly: Fox is having a great time tho
15/10/2019, 19:22 - Andrew: what time would you like me to come over on Thursday?
15/10/2019, 19:25 - Molly: I've never invited someone over for dinner before. I'm gonna guess 7ish but I might be flustered and burning the kitchen down
15/10/2019, 19:25 - Molly: Are you doing stuff before hand? Youre welcome over whenever really
15/10/2019, 19:36 - Andrew: you'll be fine and your meal will be delicious
15/10/2019, 19:37 - Andrew: i will come over at 6ish then, doing a few things in the afternoon
15/10/2019, 19:38 - Andrew: oh btw if i take a while to reply its because im deliverooing at the same time :) can't really cycle and text :p
15/10/2019, 19:41 - Andrew: I'll bring wine
15/10/2019, 20:09 - Andrew: (Media Omitted)
15/10/2019, 21:31 - Molly: Nice knee üòâ
15/10/2019, 21:31 - Molly: I just got out of class. Sorry for the radio silence
15/10/2019, 21:34 - Andrew: that's ok
15/10/2019, 21:34 - Andrew: i prefer your knee ;)
15/10/2019, 21:34 - Andrew: both knees
15/10/2019, 21:35 - Molly: Well they're significantly less hairy
15/10/2019, 22:15 - Andrew: you asleep now?
15/10/2019, 22:15 - Andrew: just had a phonecall with my mum, updating her on my job hunt
15/10/2019, 22:16 - Molly: Such a good son!
No not yet. I should be but I got home so late
15/10/2019, 22:18 - Andrew: another early start tomorrow then :(
15/10/2019, 22:18 - Molly: Yup 5:20 every day üò≠
15/10/2019, 22:19 - Andrew: it would take me ages to get used to that
15/10/2019, 22:19 - Andrew: why not just start later :p
15/10/2019, 22:21 - Molly: Because I would then have to drive home at rush hour, and I go gym after work, which sucks at that time
15/10/2019, 22:21 - Molly: I'm just super tired all the time. I miss working from home
15/10/2019, 22:22 - Andrew: oh :(
15/10/2019, 22:22 - Andrew: and youre working Thursday right?
15/10/2019, 22:23 - Molly: Yeah but not Friday so I'll stay up late. And go to bed super early tomorrow
15/10/2019, 22:24 - Andrew: we don't have to stay up late Thursday if youre tired
15/10/2019, 22:25 - Andrew: i quite like lazing around in bed
15/10/2019, 22:26 - Molly: I'll serve you dinner in bed then
15/10/2019, 22:26 - Andrew: I think you'll benefit from one of my highly skilled massages to relax you
15/10/2019, 22:26 - Andrew: üòª
15/10/2019, 22:27 - Andrew: ok no being in bed at 7pm is too early, I'll sit at a table for it :p
15/10/2019, 22:27 - Molly: Are you just gonna poke me tho?
15/10/2019, 22:27 - Molly: Thanks you're so classy
15/10/2019, 22:27 - Andrew: üëâüèº theyre not just pokes
15/10/2019, 22:27 - Molly: What
15/10/2019, 22:28 - Andrew: theyre relaxing pokes
15/10/2019, 22:28 - Molly: I disagree
15/10/2019, 22:28 - Andrew: stress relieving prodding
15/10/2019, 22:28 - Molly: Nope
15/10/2019, 22:28 - Andrew: üëâüèº

16/10/2019, 09:50 - Molly: Don't forget to have a big birthday breakfast
16/10/2019, 09:50 - Andrew: oh I will üåù
16/10/2019, 09:50 - Andrew: and will try and force myself into a long run to burn it all off
16/10/2019, 09:51 - Andrew: I know how to have fun...
16/10/2019, 09:53 - Molly: Oh boy, that'll be fun. Not sure why you would do that to yourself
16/10/2019, 11:35 - Andrew: it's fun, in a way
16/10/2019, 11:36 - Andrew: or at least feels amazing to stagger through my front door and relax after it
16/10/2019, 11:47 - Molly: Yeah I agree with that
16/10/2019, 11:48 - Andrew: how are the brushes today?
16/10/2019, 11:58 - Molly: Same old boring brushes. Nothing new. Only 3 hours left though
16/10/2019, 13:24 - Andrew: 1h30m now :D
16/10/2019, 13:24 - Andrew: (Media Omitted)
16/10/2019, 13:28 - Molly: Wow I'm so jealous, so sunny today
16/10/2019, 13:39 - Andrew: may even get more tanned!
16/10/2019, 13:39 - Andrew: üë±üèæ
16/10/2019, 13:45 - Molly: You ain't blonde tho
16/10/2019, 13:47 - Andrew: üë®üèø
16/10/2019, 13:48 - Molly: Whoa
16/10/2019, 13:48 - Molly: Can't be doing that
16/10/2019, 13:52 - Andrew: üë®üèΩ‚Äçüíª
16/10/2019, 13:52 - Andrew: that is the most accurate
16/10/2019, 13:53 - Andrew: I got another interview for a bristol job next week!
16/10/2019, 13:55 - Molly: Oh What's the job?
16/10/2019, 14:12 - Andrew: junior developer
16/10/2019, 14:12 - Andrew: it's based at paintworks
16/10/2019, 14:14 - Andrew: and i would learn a lot of stuff very quickly, mainly React, GraphQL and Laravel
16/10/2019, 14:15 - Andrew: which are all devlopment frameworks, very in-demand skills
16/10/2019, 14:15 - Molly: So fancy! That would be amazing!
16/10/2019, 14:16 - Molly: Sounds super confusing, but I'm so happy for you. You're gonna nail that interview
16/10/2019, 14:16 - Andrew: yeah it is confusing, I don't even know what GraphQL is at the moment :P
16/10/2019, 14:17 - Andrew: I should totally brush up on it tomorrow
16/10/2019, 14:22 - Molly: But you don't need to know everything, right? You'll be a junior
16/10/2019, 14:30 - Andrew: yeeah, but I would like to make a good impression
16/10/2019, 14:30 - Andrew: the job spec says they don't do formal interviews or code tests
16/10/2019, 14:30 - Andrew: and i've been told my social skills are a boon to my job chances in this industry
16/10/2019, 14:35 - Molly: Then you're gonna be amazing üòä
16/10/2019, 14:35 - Andrew: thanks :)

16/10/2019, 18:41 - Molly: Good ü•∞
16/10/2019, 18:44 - Andrew: so you think i'd be cuter if I was chubby? :P
16/10/2019, 18:54 - Molly: I think you're cutest when you're happy and not worried about your weight, because you're the cutest either way
16/10/2019, 18:55 - Andrew: that put a big smile on my face :D
16/10/2019, 18:56 - Molly: Good! Now go eat like a pig

17/10/2019, 08:43 - Molly: You get home okay last night?
17/10/2019, 08:47 - Andrew: that's good, I slept pretty badly last night, think i'll need a nap later.
17/10/2019, 08:47 - Andrew: i rolled home and then went straight to bed, and I kept waking up at night :(
17/10/2019, 08:52 - Molly: Must be that dangerous mix of foods
17/10/2019, 08:52 - Molly: Like, how well does beef stew go with Mac n cheese
17/10/2019, 08:52 - Andrew: fairly well
17/10/2019, 08:52 - Andrew: i wouldn't recommend it though
17/10/2019, 08:53 - Andrew: i ate so much meat last night, i'm a terrible person
17/10/2019, 08:54 - Andrew: and beef is the worst thing for the planet
17/10/2019, 08:57 - Molly: Maybe if you eat it all, no one else can, and then everyone will forget what beef even is
17/10/2019, 09:04 - Andrew: that's a flawless plan üëå
17/10/2019, 09:04 - Andrew: i'll just need to eat all the cows now
17/10/2019, 09:05 - Andrew: i'll probably not eat until this afternoon, i'm still full üò¨
17/10/2019, 09:08 - Molly: Good. If you're super hungry tonight, then my cooking will taste good even if it's bad
17/10/2019, 09:08 - Andrew: i'll be hungry and it will taste good anyway!
17/10/2019, 09:09 - Andrew: shall we watch terrible american tv again? or a film or something
17/10/2019, 09:12 - Molly: Yeah sure, but I'm gonna need your dad skills in setting up the tv
17/10/2019, 09:23 - Andrew: if that's the case we may be looking at a blank screen for a while
17/10/2019, 09:24 - Andrew: or just listen to nils frahm :p
17/10/2019, 09:26 - Molly: Dw I literally just need to move it to the living room and plug it in
17/10/2019, 09:26 - Molly: Think you can handle that?
17/10/2019, 09:29 - Andrew: mmm possibly
17/10/2019, 09:29 - Andrew: when on friday is your mum arriving again?
17/10/2019, 09:31 - Molly: Not till the afternoon. Like 3 or 4. She's gonna text me when she's setting off. Dw, there'll be no cross over

17/10/2019, 10:45 - Andrew: written in something called JSX and it's confusing üò¶
17/10/2019, 10:52 - Molly: Hmmm I think I'll stick to simple brushes
17/10/2019, 10:53 - Molly: (Media Omitted)
17/10/2019, 10:55 - Andrew: what is the black hemisphere for?
17/10/2019, 10:55 - Molly: Very disappointingly, it's not for anything
17/10/2019, 10:56 - Molly: Actually it's annoying me now, I've never actually thought about it
17/10/2019, 10:56 - Molly: Thanks for that
17/10/2019, 10:56 - Andrew: well it's a nice aesthetic

17/10/2019, 10:58 - Molly: No I'm fuming. 3 years and I never once thought about it. It doesn't even move
17/10/2019, 10:58 - Molly: What is for?!
17/10/2019, 11:19 - Andrew: maybe the person that made it put it in so that people would wonder what it's for

17/10/2019, 11:37 - Molly: Would it be 9-5?
17/10/2019, 11:37 - Andrew: i think they are flexible on start times, it's also common in dev jobs to work from home once or twice a week

Thank you for your email and apologies for only just getting back to you.



The recruitment process has taken slightly longer than anticipated and Ron is currently out of the office this week.



We will get back to you as soon as possible but in the meantime I will see if I can get any further updates for you.



Kind regards,

Travel Chapter Careers Team

29/10/2019, 19:42 - Andrew: well children clearly aren't always rational
29/10/2019, 19:43 - Andrew: and teens are dumb
29/10/2019, 19:43 - Andrew: adults are only slightly less dumb though
29/10/2019, 19:43 - Molly: Yeh but teen girl still smarter than adult boy
29/10/2019, 19:43 - Molly: üòè
29/10/2019, 19:48 - Andrew: just met someone who recognised me from my bike and looking like my dad!!
29/10/2019, 19:48 - Andrew: so strange!
29/10/2019, 19:50 - Molly: Wait what I don't understand
29/10/2019, 19:56 - Andrew: i didnt know her but she knows my dad
29/10/2019, 19:56 - Andrew: and recognised my bike because my dad probably posted it at some point
29/10/2019, 19:56 - Andrew: and because i look a lot like my dad
29/10/2019, 20:11 - Molly: Whoa that's so spooky!!!
29/10/2019, 20:14 - Andrew: 2spooky
29/10/2019, 20:38 - Molly: 5me
29/10/2019, 20:43 - Andrew: it would be 5me if i said 3spooky
29/10/2019, 20:44 - Molly: Oh I thought you did üò¢
29/10/2019, 20:44 - Andrew: apparently the woman knew my dad from when she was a child, they met up a few times when my dad was young and the woman's auntie left me money in her will!
29/10/2019, 20:44 - Andrew: what a strange coincidence
29/10/2019, 20:46 - Molly: Ew this is getting super spooky. Who is this woman
29/10/2019, 20:46 - Andrew: my dad says:
29/10/2019, 20:46 - Andrew: My mum had a friend called Aunty Pat.  And there was a third friend who had a daughter called Jenny.  We all met up a few times when I was a child.   Aunty Pat left me money in her will, and later there was a bit more money.  We'd moved to Cheshire and the executor of the will had lost track of me. Jenny found me via Facebook.
29/10/2019, 20:47 - Molly: Wow that's insane
29/10/2019, 20:47 - Andrew: i'm amazed that she recognised my bike
29/10/2019, 20:49 - Andrew: i managed to read that bsl fb thing quite quickly :)
29/10/2019, 21:11 - Molly: Well done! It's a really good way to practice
29/10/2019, 21:12 - Molly: But the hands are reversed so it's from your point of view. It's harder to read someone else spelling
29/10/2019, 22:51 - Andrew: yeah that would take me far too long still
29/10/2019, 22:52 - Andrew: I'll need to wet shave for my wayne look on Thursday üò¨
30/10/2019, 07:05 - Molly: No don't! üò° Wayne can have a beard
30/10/2019, 08:38 - Andrew: but wayne doesn't have a beard
30/10/2019, 08:39 - Andrew: and i need the authentic look
30/10/2019, 08:39 - Andrew: wet shave or close trim ü§î
30/10/2019, 08:49 - Molly: No!
30/10/2019, 08:49 - Molly: I like your beard!
30/10/2019, 08:49 - Molly: I will be sad!
30/10/2019, 08:50 - Molly: You and my boss text me same time. I had to be so fukin careful just then
30/10/2019, 09:48 - Andrew: maybe just a close trim then
30/10/2019, 09:49 - Molly: Maybe no trim
30/10/2019, 09:49 - Andrew: maybe he would've enjoyed the compliment on his beard
30/10/2019, 09:49 - Andrew: if he has one
30/10/2019, 09:49 - Andrew: wayne doesn't have a beard!
30/10/2019, 09:49 - Molly: He'd look good with a beard
30/10/2019, 10:33 - Andrew: how sad would you be if I was clean-shaven?
30/10/2019, 10:34 - Molly: You're making me so nervous
30/10/2019, 10:34 - Molly: Did you do it
30/10/2019, 10:34 - Molly: I'm gonna kill you
30/10/2019, 10:35 - Andrew: I see
30/10/2019, 10:35 - Molly: BABE
30/10/2019, 10:35 - Molly: NO
30/10/2019, 10:35 - Andrew: might need to buy a fake beard now
30/10/2019, 10:35 - Molly: Babe I'm so mad
30/10/2019, 10:35 - Andrew: (Media Omitted)
30/10/2019, 10:36 - Molly: NOT FUNNY
30/10/2019, 10:36 - Andrew: üåù
30/10/2019, 10:36 - Molly: Don't shave, ok?
30/10/2019, 10:36 - Andrew: it does need tidying up however
30/10/2019, 10:38 - Andrew: you always say how it scratches your face though
30/10/2019, 10:39 - Molly: If you shave, it'll be soft for one day, then like fuking knives
30/10/2019, 10:39 - Molly: Also I'm scared I won't recognise you
30/10/2019, 10:40 - Andrew: I will look completely different
30/10/2019, 10:40 - Andrew: entirely
30/10/2019, 10:40 - Molly: But I like how you look now
30/10/2019, 10:40 - Andrew: my beard contains most of my natural charisma and charm too
30/10/2019, 10:41 - Andrew: so I will be totally different
30/10/2019, 10:41 - Andrew: my neck is out of control though
30/10/2019, 10:41 - Andrew: (Media Omitted)
30/10/2019, 10:42 - Andrew: that's such a weird photo
30/10/2019, 10:44 - Molly: Yeah Ew what am I looking at
30/10/2019, 10:44 - Molly: Is this the only way you can see underneath?
30/10/2019, 10:45 - Andrew: yeah
30/10/2019, 10:45 - Andrew: all that neck hair is getting shaved
30/10/2019, 10:47 - Molly: But gradient, right? Don't just do a harsh line. You ain't gettin away with contouring
30/10/2019, 10:54 - Andrew: i shave the neck hair and the line is under my jaw so you don't really see it
30/10/2019, 10:55 - Andrew: ain't noone got time to counter under their jaw
30/10/2019, 10:56 - Molly: No no no the rest of us can see it. We can see it. Anyone shorter than you can see the line
30/10/2019, 11:16 - Andrew: well i'm going to do it the normal way tomorrow
30/10/2019, 11:18 - Molly: Okay
30/10/2019, 11:19 - Molly: I have a lot of opinions on your facial hair
30/10/2019, 11:19 - Andrew: well I could still shave it :P
30/10/2019, 11:20 - Molly: I will leave you until it grows back
30/10/2019, 11:20 - Andrew: well it grows back very quickly
30/10/2019, 11:21 - Andrew: or to current length you mean
30/10/2019, 11:21 - Molly: Enjoy Halloween alone
30/10/2019, 11:22 - Andrew: i didn't know my beard had this much influence on us seeing each other
30/10/2019, 11:23 - Andrew: does it mean if I grow to wizard beard length you will see me all day everyday?
30/10/2019, 11:26 - Molly: Yes but only in the shire
30/10/2019, 11:27 - Molly: And you be required to say badass wizard aphorisms
30/10/2019, 12:28 - Andrew: (Media Omitted)
30/10/2019, 12:30 - Molly: He's watching you
30/10/2019, 12:30 - Andrew: he's gone now
30/10/2019, 12:31 - Molly: üò¢
30/10/2019, 12:31 - Andrew: or just watching me from a different place
30/10/2019, 12:31 - Molly: HE'S IN THE HOUSE
30/10/2019, 12:32 - Andrew: he's back
30/10/2019, 12:33 - Andrew: marking his territory in the neighbours garden
30/10/2019, 12:33 - Andrew: DISGOSTEN
30/10/2019, 12:37 - Molly: He owns this neighborhood
30/10/2019, 12:51 - Andrew: I'm limping slightly üëéüèº
30/10/2019, 12:51 - Andrew: pulled a muscle in my ankle
30/10/2019, 12:52 - Molly: How???
30/10/2019, 12:52 - Andrew: running most likely
30/10/2019, 12:52 - Molly: Awh baby. You been running this morning?
30/10/2019, 12:52 - Andrew: yeah a short run
30/10/2019, 12:53 - Andrew: ive done it 3 days in a row, maybe my ankles aren't so strong at the moment
30/10/2019, 12:53 - Molly: Hmmm probably bruised the muscle if it keeps happening
30/10/2019, 12:53 - Molly: Sure it's not a strain
30/10/2019, 12:53 - Molly: ?
30/10/2019, 13:00 - Andrew: urm maybe
30/10/2019, 13:00 - Andrew: i should warm up a bit before running
30/10/2019, 13:01 - Andrew: which I used to do but now I'm just lazy
30/10/2019, 13:32 - Molly: If it is a strain, give it time to heal. It's unlikely you're pulling the same muscle everytime.
30/10/2019, 13:32 - Molly: But you can run on a strain, just be careful
30/10/2019, 13:44 - Molly: I'm worried about you. Please don't hurt yourself
30/10/2019, 14:00 - Andrew: it feels alright now
30/10/2019, 14:00 - Andrew: after warming up a bit
30/10/2019, 14:00 - Andrew: I'll be fine! I'm tough
30/10/2019, 14:01 - Andrew: from deliverooing on the mean streets of Bristol
30/10/2019, 14:05 - Molly: Be careful! You're just a big softy full of squishy important organs

13/11/2019, 20:52 - Molly: We had to queue to do this
13/11/2019, 20:53 - Molly: You get 1 snap
13/11/2019, 20:53 - Molly: They said we can't touch them
13/11/2019, 20:53 - Andrew: they didn't say you couldn't caress them though
13/11/2019, 20:53 - Andrew: or embrace them
13/11/2019, 20:54 - Andrew: was it worth it?
13/11/2019, 20:57 - Molly: No yeah they did say that. Apparently another group got too handsy so no hugs
13/11/2019, 20:57 - Andrew: pfft that group had to ruin it for everyone else didn't they
13/11/2019, 20:57 - Molly: Tbh i feel weird about it. I wouldn't've done it first time around, nor I'm doing again

13/11/2019, 21:06 - Molly: You mean the one behind me?
13/11/2019, 21:15 - Andrew: hey, he's touching you!
13/11/2019, 21:17 - Andrew: so you can't touch them but they can touch you
13/11/2019, 21:17 - Andrew: I don't like the sound of that

25/11/2019, 14:18 - Andrew: im trying but they gave the worst phone system in the world
25/11/2019, 14:18 - Andrew: god it's frustrating
25/11/2019, 14:20 - Andrew: it's just so stupid
25/11/2019, 14:28 - Molly: That sucks so much honey
25/11/2019, 14:37 - Andrew: they have different numbers for uber and ubereats, takes ages to transfer between them, you sometimes can't hear the messages, endless menus to go through, the system reads back numbers you've typed in very slowly, some options just tell you to view "Help" on the app but my issue is that my app isn't working, and then after telling you that it hangs up!
25/11/2019, 14:46 - Molly: Wow that's the worst
25/11/2019, 14:46 - Molly: Have you tried spamming 0?
25/11/2019, 14:46 - Molly: Sometimes that gets you through to a person
25/11/2019, 14:48 - Molly: Did you want to push back dinner? If so just let me know and I'll work late
25/11/2019, 14:49 - Andrew: no i'm still fine for 4.30
25/11/2019, 14:50 - Andrew: means I can start deliverooing around 6-6.15
25/11/2019, 14:52 - Molly: You'll probably need to start cooking before I get there then. It'll take an hour for the roasties
25/11/2019, 14:53 - Andrew: alright well i'll cut them and put them at 4.30 or so
25/11/2019, 14:53 - Andrew: or a bit before
25/11/2019, 14:56 - Molly: Okay. I reckon I'll get to yours for 4:20ish
25/11/2019, 15:07 - Andrew: üåùü§ôüèº
25/11/2019, 16:16 - Molly: Just pulled up
25/11/2019, 16:16 - Andrew: aight
25/11/2019, 19:45 - Andrew: all the buses at the fountains are at a stand still
25/11/2019, 19:46 - Andrew: saw a woman under a bus who had just been hit by it
25/11/2019, 19:46 - Andrew: big crowd had gathered
25/11/2019, 19:46 - Andrew: she was moving and conscious but still looked pretty bad
25/11/2019, 20:01 - Molly: Holy shit!
25/11/2019, 20:01 - Molly: That's insane
25/11/2019, 20:02 - Andrew: she hit the front of the bus because the side of the windscreen was cracked
25/11/2019, 20:03 - Molly: Whoa
25/11/2019, 20:03 - Molly: That's intense
25/11/2019, 20:03 - Molly: Can't imagine how she feels
25/11/2019, 20:05 - Andrew: anyway ive made 38 quid today im going to go home, make some music, play some bach and sleep
25/11/2019, 20:27 - Molly: Sounds perfect
25/11/2019, 20:27 - Molly: I'm studying rn. Might need a study buddy on the weekend
25/11/2019, 20:37 - Andrew: I'm sure I can make some time on the weekend
25/11/2019, 20:37 - Andrew: in my hectic schedule
25/11/2019, 20:40 - Molly: Are you trying to make me feel guilty
25/11/2019, 20:40 - Andrew: not at all
25/11/2019, 20:47 - Molly: Hmmm
25/11/2019, 20:47 - Andrew: i was being self deprecating
25/11/2019, 20:47 - Molly: HMMM
25/11/2019, 20:49 - Molly: I do think at some point we probably have to talk
25/11/2019, 20:49 - Andrew: how do you mean?
25/11/2019, 20:50 - Andrew: about us?
25/11/2019, 20:50 - Molly: Yeah, don't you think?
25/11/2019, 20:51 - Andrew: of course
25/11/2019, 20:52 - Andrew: did you not want me to come to the thanksgiving party because we hadn't talked about us yet?
25/11/2019, 20:52 - Molly: That's why I'm nervous about introducing to my friends/family before we've talked
25/11/2019, 20:52 - Molly: Yes
25/11/2019, 20:52 - Molly: Haha spot on
25/11/2019, 20:52 - Andrew: yeah, I got that impression
25/11/2019, 20:53 - Andrew: I genuinely don't mind about that btw
25/11/2019, 20:53 - Molly: That's cuz I said it out loud
25/11/2019, 20:53 - Molly: Thanks for understanding
25/11/2019, 20:53 - Molly: Ew that looks sarcastic. I promise it's not
25/11/2019, 20:54 - Andrew: yeah i know :P)
25/11/2019, 20:54 - Andrew: :)*
25/11/2019, 20:55 - Molly: How about Thursday, we go bath market, have Christmassy fun times, maybe a drink a two and come back and have a super chill talk?
25/11/2019, 20:57 - Andrew: yeah that sounds nice, looking forward to it
25/11/2019, 20:58 - Andrew: super chill but possibly we're both drunk you mean?
25/11/2019, 21:02 - Molly: Maaaybe
25/11/2019, 21:02 - Andrew: üåù
25/11/2019, 21:03 - Andrew: I overuse that emoji now
25/11/2019, 21:03 - Andrew: when do you want to get the train to bath on thursday?
25/11/2019, 21:04 - Molly: If I work late Wednesday I could leave early Thursday and have plenty time to get ready. Potentially 4ish?
25/11/2019, 21:05 - Molly: Later is fine too if you want
25/11/2019, 21:05 - Andrew: 4 would be fine üëçüèº
25/11/2019, 21:05 - Molly: Brill
25/11/2019, 21:05 - Andrew: looking forward to mulled wine and some actually decent markets
25/11/2019, 21:10 - Molly: Expensive but good. I just love the atmosphere and free samples
25/11/2019, 21:10 - Andrew: yeah i often get free cheese samples at the bristol market
25/11/2019, 21:11 - Andrew: and then usually buy some cheese for christmas day because i feel guilty for eating lots of their cheese
25/11/2019, 21:14 - Molly: That's how they get ya!
25/11/2019, 21:14 - Andrew: i know
25/11/2019, 21:14 - Andrew: they played me
25/11/2019, 21:16 - Molly: Cheese con
25/11/2019, 21:41 - Andrew: niall has been vomitting all day in latvia :/
25/11/2019, 21:41 - Andrew: him and dana got sick from something
25/11/2019, 21:42 - Molly: Oh no! That's awful!!
25/11/2019, 21:44 - Andrew: someone in the deliveroo chat heard the woman being hit by a bus
25/11/2019, 21:44 - Andrew: and how terrible the screaming was
25/11/2019, 21:44 - Andrew: üòß
25/11/2019, 21:47 - Molly: Ugh god I don't wanna think about it
25/11/2019, 22:34 - Molly: Night baby
25/11/2019, 22:34 - Molly: (Media Omitted)
25/11/2019, 23:18 - Andrew: that's excellent
25/11/2019, 23:22 - Andrew: (Media Omitted)
26/11/2019, 05:57 - Molly: (Media Omitted)
26/11/2019, 19:30 - Andrew: I'm gonna start doing more website testing over the next few weeks
26/11/2019, 19:30 - Andrew: bit more dollar
26/11/2019, 19:31 - Molly: Good plan
26/11/2019, 19:31 - Molly: Is it fun
26/11/2019, 19:31 - Andrew: it's tolerable
26/11/2019, 19:31 - Andrew: and min wage
26/11/2019, 19:32 - Andrew: but it's aight
26/11/2019, 19:32 - Andrew: and i can do it in my living room
26/11/2019, 19:37 - Molly: That sounds pretty dope tbh
26/11/2019, 19:39 - Andrew: bike work is usually better money
26/11/2019, 19:39 - Andrew: and testing can get very boring sometimes
26/11/2019, 19:40 - Andrew: when I have to do data entry üòë
26/11/2019, 21:15 - Andrew: just had a house meeting
26/11/2019, 21:15 - Andrew: it's was pretty tense
26/11/2019, 21:16 - Molly: Hey. Just got home
26/11/2019, 21:16 - Molly: What was it about?
26/11/2019, 21:16 - Andrew: lorn was annoyed about things me and luke were doing that he never even mentioned before
26/11/2019, 21:17 - Andrew: things like food sharing, washing stuff, cleaning up
26/11/2019, 21:17 - Andrew: ü§îü§îü§î
26/11/2019, 21:18 - Molly: I actually thought you guys were pretty clean and organized. But I did notice someone, I'm guessing lorn, was drawing stars on everything to denote it as his
26/11/2019, 21:18 - Andrew: yeah that's him
26/11/2019, 21:19 - Molly: Does it annoy him that I keep staying over? I'm pretty messy and loud
26/11/2019, 21:19 - Andrew: all in all it was quite bizarre and needlessly standoffish, but i'll tell you all about it another time
26/11/2019, 21:19 - Andrew: no, didn't mention it, I doubt having guests stay over is a thing he'd be annoyed about
26/11/2019, 21:20 - Molly: Okay well that's good at least. I guess no house share is easy. There's always one
26/11/2019, 21:23 - Andrew: me and luke could be cleaner, but lorn was clearly bottling up his annoyance for a while about things I had no idea about
26/11/2019, 21:26 - Molly: You guys live in a fukin mansion compared to the rest of us. He got lucky he don't live with mice
26/11/2019, 21:26 - Andrew: that's true
26/11/2019, 21:26 - Andrew: i didn't bring that up though
26/11/2019, 21:27 - Andrew: the whole thing was very bizarre and lorn is away anyway tomorrw morning until friday so woo
26/11/2019, 21:28 - Molly: Maybe he's just having a hard time
26/11/2019, 21:29 - Andrew: yeah it's possible
26/11/2019, 21:29 - Andrew: kate said he's the quite type and he grew up in a quiet (and obivously super clean) household so living with housemate might just not be for him
26/11/2019, 21:30 - Molly: Maybe he comes from a family where they bottle everything up
26/11/2019, 21:30 - Molly: Does he have siblings?
26/11/2019, 21:30 - Andrew: no idea
26/11/2019, 21:30 - Andrew: and i probably won't ask him :P
26/11/2019, 21:31 - Molly: Cuz siblings would wreck your shit if you acted like that
26/11/2019, 21:31 - Molly: Don't you guys check in with each other?
26/11/2019, 21:32 - Andrew: well me and luke thought so, and had no idea that these things were annoying him
26/11/2019, 21:32 - Molly: Hmmm maybe he's got no one he's close to. It kinda sounds like he's sad and stressed
26/11/2019, 21:33 - Andrew: i have no clue but I'll try and be more sympathetic to him
26/11/2019, 21:33 - Andrew: just not right now
26/11/2019, 21:36 - Molly: Fair
26/11/2019, 21:56 - Andrew: i'm calmer now
26/11/2019, 21:56 - Andrew: how were the brushes today?
26/11/2019, 22:07 - Molly: Brushy
26/11/2019, 22:07 - Molly: Same old
26/11/2019, 22:31 - Andrew: nice
26/11/2019, 22:31 - Andrew: good old predictable brushes
26/11/2019, 22:33 - Andrew: bit of piano before bed I think
26/11/2019, 22:39 - Molly: Bed for me. Long day tomorrow. Night baby üòò
27/11/2019, 15:23 - Molly: 9 hours down. 2 left to go. Gonna need some motivational aphorisms please
27/11/2019, 15:24 - Andrew: "Life sucks and then you die"
27/11/2019, 15:25 - Andrew: "Everybody sucks at something"
27/11/2019, 15:25 - Andrew: "Eat right, exercise regularly, die anyway"
27/11/2019, 15:26 - Andrew: "Everything happens for no reason", I like that one
27/11/2019, 15:27 - Molly: These are not motivational!! They make me wanna die!
27/11/2019, 15:28 - Molly: Say something to keep me from wrecking this fukin place
27/11/2019, 15:29 - Andrew: urm
27/11/2019, 15:30 - Molly: You're bad at this
27/11/2019, 15:30 - Andrew: hmm I think I am
27/11/2019, 15:30 - Andrew: i'm trying to find one I heard a while ago but I can't remember who said it
27/11/2019, 15:30 - Molly: Guess this is the something you suck at
27/11/2019, 15:31 - Andrew: yeah I probably suck at motivating people
27/11/2019, 15:31 - Molly: Don't look up the one you're thinking of. I want it of the cuff. Just fukin wing it
27/11/2019, 15:31 - Molly: Give me the jist
27/11/2019, 15:31 - Andrew: "live laugh love"
27/11/2019, 15:34 - Andrew: I can't think of an aphorism but whenever I feel down or annoyed I just think of how fortunate I am in a lot of ways
27/11/2019, 15:35 - Andrew: like living in Bristol which is a really nice city, in a pretty good country and all my basics needs are met with very little effort on my part
27/11/2019, 15:37 - Andrew: remember how it feels to look up at the cosmos on a clear night
27/11/2019, 15:45 - Molly: I hate you
27/11/2019, 15:45 - Molly: And no, Ew, now I really wish I was dead
27/11/2019, 15:47 - Molly: But like all the good things I have, I had to fight so hard for. I'm alive because I kept fighting against everything. That doesn't feel like a blessing. That feels like if I stop for even a second, everything will fall apart again
27/11/2019, 15:49 - Andrew: I think it's mind-boggling that we are conscious for a flicker of cosmic time, it's like a huge honour to be part of it briefly
27/11/2019, 15:49 - Molly: Oh are you high rn?
27/11/2019, 15:49 - Andrew: makes house drama seem insignificant
27/11/2019, 15:50 - Andrew: no I just thought about all that stuff more often a long time ago
27/11/2019, 15:50 - Andrew: but whenever I dip back into it, it makes me calm
27/11/2019, 15:51 - Molly: That's nihilism and it's motivating me to wreck shit
27/11/2019, 15:52 - Andrew: i don't think life is meaningless
27/11/2019, 15:53 - Andrew: why do you think it's nihilistic?
27/11/2019, 15:53 - Molly: Because nothing is important. Everything is relatively irrelevant. And all your interesting and deep thoughts will disappear with your corporeal form
27/11/2019, 15:54 - Andrew: I don't think that at all
27/11/2019, 15:54 - Molly: This is like the basis for nihilism
27/11/2019, 15:54 - Molly: I think that
27/11/2019, 15:54 - Molly: Nihilism isn't a bad thing
27/11/2019, 15:54 - Andrew: i don't immediately see what you mean by that
27/11/2019, 15:54 - Andrew: I think people make their own meaning though
27/11/2019, 15:55 - Andrew: but what do I know really
27/11/2019, 15:55 - Molly: Oh I agree. But that in itself is meaningless
27/11/2019, 15:56 - Molly: Because everything ends eventually so fuk it lets party, ya know? Why work? Why be miserable? Go enjoy this clusterfuck while you can
27/11/2019, 15:56 - Molly: I think it's a nice thought
27/11/2019, 15:56 - Molly: I'm agreeing with you baby
27/11/2019, 15:56 - Andrew: isn't that hedonism?
27/11/2019, 15:58 - Andrew: yeah everything ends eventually, but it's not like a thought of going wild or something
27/11/2019, 15:58 - Molly: I mean, they go hand in hand
27/11/2019, 15:59 - Molly: Nothing is real (nihilism) let's enjoy this nothingness that I am the centre of (hedonism)
27/11/2019, 15:59 - Molly: Right?
27/11/2019, 15:59 - Molly: I might have that wrong
27/11/2019, 15:59 - Molly: But I like it
27/11/2019, 15:59 - Andrew: i don't know, i've forgotten what little philosophy terms I knew
27/11/2019, 16:01 - Molly: I mean, they're both chaotic neutral
27/11/2019, 16:01 - Andrew: well it's very much how I feel but hedonism doesn't really chime with how I feel about living
27/11/2019, 16:02 - Andrew: that's if I had to even put into words
27/11/2019, 16:02 - Andrew: everything is chaotic :P
27/11/2019, 16:02 - Andrew: and neutral
27/11/2019, 16:02 - Andrew: that might describe it better then
27/11/2019, 16:02 - Molly: Nah nah nah hang
27/11/2019, 16:03 - Molly: Im super into this
27/11/2019, 16:03 - Andrew: what hedonism?
27/11/2019, 16:04 - Molly: https://images.app.goo.gl/WxXbwYMntwwhTQK36
27/11/2019, 16:04 - Molly: Fuk I'm trying to send an image
27/11/2019, 16:05 - Molly: (Media Omitted)
27/11/2019, 16:05 - Andrew: well i've seen memes using that chart a lot :P
27/11/2019, 16:05 - Molly: Everyone fits into this
27/11/2019, 16:05 - Molly: Yeah it's a dnd thing but it works
27/11/2019, 16:07 - Andrew: does each person fit into one category only?
27/11/2019, 16:09 - Molly: Essentially but it's arguable. And it's just a base alignment
27/11/2019, 16:09 - Andrew: i see
27/11/2019, 16:10 - Molly: And chaotic isn't like crazy. It's like nihilism
27/11/2019, 16:10 - Andrew: maybe people fit into it at different times in different situations
27/11/2019, 16:10 - Andrew: maybe i don't know how dnd works
27/11/2019, 16:10 - Andrew: it's like pokemon cards right? üåù
27/11/2019, 16:16 - Molly: Holy shit you're joking right?
27/11/2019, 16:25 - Molly: I'm cancelling all my plans. Get some fukin dice and roll some heckin initiative
27/11/2019, 16:26 - Andrew: sorry not pokemon
27/11/2019, 16:26 - Andrew: digimon yeah?
27/11/2019, 16:26 - Molly: You're fucking with me
27/11/2019, 16:29 - Andrew: i have friends that play it and they've explained it to me before :P
27/11/2019, 16:39 - Molly: Hmmm
27/11/2019, 16:39 - Andrew: and how one of the person in their group didn't really fit in
27/11/2019, 16:39 - Andrew: because they would do things that would tend to ruin the game
27/11/2019, 16:40 - Andrew: something like that
27/11/2019, 16:42 - Molly: Yeah you have to play the game but also think about making it fun too. Can't just be trying to 'win' the whole time. It's a social event more than anything
27/11/2019, 16:44 - Andrew: yeah they said how fun it always was and how much of a bonding experience it is
27/11/2019, 16:45 - Molly: How yeah definitely. I super want to DM but it's scary, and I don't know anyone who would actually play
27/11/2019, 16:45 - Molly: *oh
27/11/2019, 16:50 - Andrew: how many people do you know that play?
27/11/2019, 16:51 - Molly: Well, there's me, but I've never played because you need at least three people...
27/11/2019, 16:51 - Molly: My brother but I've never played with him
27/11/2019, 16:51 - Molly: Yeh that's it
27/11/2019, 16:53 - Andrew: you've never played?
27/11/2019, 16:53 - Andrew: or as DM you mean?
27/11/2019, 16:54 - Molly: Nope. Never played. But I know the rules and Ive listened to 100s hours of gameplay
27/11/2019, 16:54 - Andrew: ah i see
27/11/2019, 16:55 - Andrew: there are surely groups in bristol that would welcome you
27/11/2019, 16:55 - Andrew: from what i've some groups are quite cliquey üò¨
27/11/2019, 16:57 - Molly: Yes exactly plus I'm a girl. Just imagine the gross kinda attention I would get. I used to larp and it was like I couldn't breathe without some creep complimenting me. or worse, patronising me
27/11/2019, 17:00 - Andrew: yeah that sounds like the lamest thing ever
27/11/2019, 17:01 - Andrew: the stereotype I have in my head of guys that do that isn't great
27/11/2019, 17:02 - Molly: I mean, a lot of guys are great. But it only takes a couple before it feels like everyone is calling you jailbait
27/11/2019, 17:02 - Andrew: eek/eew
27/11/2019, 17:11 - Molly: Yeah
27/11/2019, 17:12 - Molly: They were my brother's friends tho
27/11/2019, 17:14 - Andrew: maybe it sucked for him as well
27/11/2019, 17:14 - Andrew: does he still talk to those people?
27/11/2019, 17:16 - Molly: Some but I think it was more uncomfortable for him than me
27/11/2019, 17:16 - Molly: I think I was too young to fully understand what was happening
27/11/2019, 17:16 - Molly: Not that he tried to stop it
27/11/2019, 17:19 - Andrew: have you talked to him about it?
27/11/2019, 17:17 - Molly: Anyway tl:dr boys are creeps. Not all, must a lot
27/11/2019, 17:19 - Andrew: I thank tha lawd that I didn't deal with things like that
27/11/2019, 17:17 - Molly: But a lot
27/11/2019, 17:20 - Andrew: my sister told me recently that one of her friends had always thought I was hot
27/11/2019, 17:23 - Molly: I think there's something in nerd culture that makes them like younger girls, and tbh no one else was paying attention to me, and I liked that I was being noticed. I just didn't consider the danger until I actually got hurt
27/11/2019, 17:24 - Molly: I only brought it up with seph once, but it was just about one guy in particular that at the time I thought was just being friendly. He was in his 30s though
27/11/2019, 17:24 - Molly: My brother worried about him a lot
27/11/2019, 17:24 - Molly: How much older is your sister than you?
27/11/2019, 17:24 - Andrew: eeurgh

27/11/2019, 19:33 - Andrew: let's do it
27/11/2019, 21:39 - Andrew: me and luke talked about the house drama
27/11/2019, 21:39 - Andrew: we're both sympathetic because he clearly hasn't lived with many people before
27/11/2019, 21:40 - Andrew: haven't had a good gossip for ages me
27/11/2019, 21:45 - Molly: Ooo boy gossip. What's that like
27/11/2019, 21:45 - Molly: I instinctively wann get in on this
27/11/2019, 21:45 - Andrew: haha
27/11/2019, 21:46 - Andrew: well actually we were both fairly reasonable
27/11/2019, 21:46 - Molly: Boooo boring
27/11/2019, 21:46 - Andrew: prepare to be disappointed when I tell you in person
27/11/2019, 21:46 - Andrew: told luke about when he unknowingly offended the cleaners
27/11/2019, 21:47 - Andrew: luke had sent lorn a message when he saw the note of "things to tell housemates" that he didn't appreciate the passive agressiveness
27/11/2019, 21:47 - Molly: (Media Omitted)
27/11/2019, 21:48 - Andrew: (Media Omitted)
27/11/2019, 21:47 - Molly: Wait what
27/11/2019, 21:48 - Andrew: told luke about when lorn unknowingly offended them*
27/11/2019, 21:49 - Andrew: can't remember if i mentioned but lorn left a list of "things to tell housemates" on the kitchen table, for a day or two
27/11/2019, 21:50 - Andrew: I had read it on friday morning
27/11/2019, 21:50 - Andrew: and the house chat was last night, so I had some time to think of what I would say
27/11/2019, 21:56 - Molly: Omg you guys are way worse than girls. That's so petty!!!
27/11/2019, 21:57 - Molly: I love it
27/11/2019, 21:57 - Andrew: i would never do that!
27/11/2019, 21:57 - Molly: Remind me how lorn offended the cleaners
27/11/2019, 21:57 - Andrew: haha
27/11/2019, 21:57 - Andrew: well
27/11/2019, 21:57 - Andrew: (Media Omitted)
27/11/2019, 21:58 - Molly: Go on
27/11/2019, 22:00 - Andrew: kate(landlady) previously told ben(old housemate) to ask the cleaners to hoover the top room in the house, which isn't a communal area. ben left a few months ago and i said to the cleaners just keep doing the same areas as before, including the top room, as i remember kate saying she wanted it done, as it was her old room.

first time (i think) that lorn meets the cleaners, he tells them which areas to clean and don't do the top room

just after that, when i was in the front room getting ready to go out the two cleaners came in to the front room with me and shut the door and complained that he was bossing them around, because I was the one mainly speaking to them (i had their phone number and they would notify me when they were about to arrive, they tell me if i'm running low on cleaning supplies etc
27/11/2019, 22:01 - Andrew: basically I think Lorn hadn't introduced himself (might be wrong on that) and told them what to do
27/11/2019, 22:02 - Andrew: that's pretty much it
27/11/2019, 22:04 - Molly: Hmmm that's not a good attitude to have. I just think he's never learnt to filter his words
27/11/2019, 22:05 - Molly: It probably would've been fine to tell the cleaners not to do top room if he had just been a bit more thoughtful about his words
27/11/2019, 22:05 - Molly: How old is he?
27/11/2019, 22:05 - Andrew: think he's 33-34
27/11/2019, 22:06 - Molly: Oof, not good at that age. Big red flag. He'll probably never change
27/11/2019, 22:09 - Andrew: well it seems likely there's going to be some tension soon
27/11/2019, 22:09 - Andrew: me and luke could do with being a bit cleaner but lorn is on a different wavelength
27/11/2019, 22:10 - Andrew: i don't talk to him all that much so i will make an effort to be a bit more sociable
27/11/2019, 22:13 - Molly: He's probably got some deep seated issues
27/11/2019, 22:13 - Molly: Tell me everything tomorrow baby. I want that tea
27/11/2019, 22:13 - Molly: Goodnight for now üòò
27/11/2019, 22:14 - Andrew: (Media Omitted)

28/11/2019, 08:51 - Andrew: ok
28/11/2019, 08:51 - Molly: I'll probably be ready way before 3, but just in case
28/11/2019, 08:51 - Andrew: ur always pretty babe

01/12/2019, 11:36 - Molly: Working hard?
01/12/2019, 11:37 - Andrew: nah just, tidying, working out, looking at what tracksuit i want to buy
01/12/2019, 11:40 - Molly: Why are you buying a tracksuit
01/12/2019, 11:41 - Andrew: i want thinner ones with a tapered bottom
01/12/2019, 11:41 - Andrew: so my socks look better when i tuck the tracksuits in to them
01/12/2019, 11:43 - Andrew: it's cool these days
01/12/2019, 11:45 - Andrew: (Media Omitted)
01/12/2019, 11:45 - Molly: Jesus Christ
01/12/2019, 11:45 - Molly: Show me the ones you're looking at
01/12/2019, 11:46 - Andrew: maybe not that far though, reminds me too much of nazi uniform trousers
01/12/2019, 11:46 - Andrew: none in particular really
01/12/2019, 11:48 - Andrew: adidas wind breaker thin tracksuits maybe
01/12/2019, 11:50 - Molly: I'm on the fence
01/12/2019, 11:50 - Andrew: that means you don't like it :P
01/12/2019, 11:50 - Molly: I usually don't like tracksuits
01/12/2019, 11:51 - Molly: But if it's statement
01/12/2019, 11:51 - Andrew: well it's very practical for riding
01/12/2019, 11:51 - Andrew: warmer on the lower legs with socks tucked in and less chance for the fabric to get caught in the chain
01/12/2019, 11:51 - Andrew: and the socks I plan to wear will be a talking point for restaurant staff
01/12/2019, 11:52 - Andrew: slightly higher chances of getting free food from them
01/12/2019, 12:03 - Molly: How wild do you think you can get your socks
01/12/2019, 12:03 - Andrew: probably not light up ones
01/12/2019, 12:03 - Andrew: but I would like garish christmas themed socks
01/12/2019, 12:04 - Molly: Gross
01/12/2019, 12:04 - Molly: I love it
01/12/2019, 12:07 - Andrew: possibly with dogs or cats on
01/12/2019, 12:07 - Molly: That's cute
01/12/2019, 12:08 - Molly: I just remembered we were gonna go cycling
01/12/2019, 12:08 - Molly: I'm so sorry baby
01/12/2019, 12:09 - Andrew: it might be a bit late now
01/12/2019, 12:09 - Andrew: we can go another time
01/12/2019, 12:09 - Molly: Okay baby üò¢

01/12/2019, 12:10 - Molly: And hungover
01/12/2019, 12:10 - Andrew: I suspected you would be a bit hungover
01/12/2019, 12:10 - Molly: I'm surprised the alcohol got to me
01/12/2019, 12:10 - Andrew: cycling after a big night just doesn't seem fun sometimes
01/12/2019, 12:10 - Molly: I did drink a lot
01/12/2019, 12:10 - Andrew: how much?
01/12/2019, 12:11 - Molly: Legit no idea, but I was constantly drink. No stopping
01/12/2019, 12:11 - Andrew: until when?
01/12/2019, 12:11 - Molly: About 1
01/12/2019, 12:11 - Molly: 8pm - 1am
01/12/2019, 12:11 - Andrew: yeah i wouldn't want to cycle after that :P
01/12/2019, 12:11 - Molly: But I ate lots too
01/12/2019, 12:12 - Andrew: nice
01/12/2019, 12:12 - Andrew: i got a mcdonalds yesterday, really shouldn't have
01/12/2019, 12:13 - Molly: Why not
01/12/2019, 12:14 - Andrew: i have been eating badly recently
01/12/2019, 12:14 - Andrew: didn't eat for 19 hours after that though so i've probably offset it
01/12/2019, 12:14 - Andrew: partially
01/12/2019, 12:15 - Molly: We'll get on the health binge. Dw baby
01/12/2019, 12:15 - Molly: üèÉ‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏èü•ó

01/12/2019, 13:11 - Molly: I know. I don't wanna go home
01/12/2019, 13:12 - Andrew: you stayed over?
01/12/2019, 13:12 - Andrew: (Media Omitted)
01/12/2019, 13:12 - Andrew: my friend alan
01/12/2019, 13:12 - Andrew: who now clearly loves drag race
01/12/2019, 13:12 - Molly: This is excellent
01/12/2019, 13:15 - Molly: Yeah I stayed over
01/12/2019, 15:02 - Andrew: just encountered a very grumpy rider
01/12/2019, 15:04 - Andrew: i was waiting next to him and he accidentally hit me with his elbow which probably surprised him
01/12/2019, 15:04 - Andrew: and he said mate you're in my personal space
01/12/2019, 15:04 - Andrew: get out of my space it's obnoxious
01/12/2019, 15:04 - Andrew: and then packed his bag whilst leaning against me
01/12/2019, 15:05 - Andrew: acting like a bully! he looked like he was in his late 30s!
01/12/2019, 15:11 - Molly: Jesus. He probably hates millennials and is jealous of you
01/12/2019, 15:12 - Molly: Least you're not middle-aged and still doing delivrrood
01/12/2019, 15:20 - Andrew: well I might be at this rate :p
01/12/2019, 15:20 - Andrew: was quite bizarre really
01/12/2019, 15:20 - Andrew: if I see him again let's hope he's not in a bad mood, might try and talk to him
01/12/2019, 15:21 - Andrew: or maybe he's just a dickhead all the time
01/12/2019, 15:22 - Molly: Nah leave it. I have no patience for people who are unnecessarily aggressive
01/12/2019, 15:26 - Andrew: yeah probz not worth it
01/12/2019, 15:26 - Andrew: think I'd seen him on the road maybe twice before
01/12/2019, 15:26 - Molly: You're a better person than him
01/12/2019, 15:27 - Andrew: the only grumpy courier I've encountered for over 3 1/2 years at least
01/12/2019, 15:29 - Molly: I wonder why he was so mad
01/12/2019, 15:36 - Andrew: could be any number of things, it's east to get into a negative mindset on this job
01/12/2019, 15:36 - Andrew: not paid much, dealing with traffic
01/12/2019, 15:37 - Andrew: i need a papa grill
01/12/2019, 15:44 - Molly: Baby careful. You keep eating take out. It's not healthy
01/12/2019, 15:52 - Andrew: i know

01/12/2019, 16:02 - Andrew: some coleslaw
01/12/2019, 16:02 - Andrew: and the rest is animals and bread
01/12/2019, 16:05 - Molly: Least that's some veg
01/12/2019, 18:32 - Andrew: now there's kids outside McDonalds
01/12/2019, 18:32 - Andrew: my bike didn't feel safe
01/12/2019, 18:33 - Molly: Hmm not good
01/12/2019, 18:33 - Andrew: feels like a very weird shift today
01/12/2019, 18:34 - Molly: How come
01/12/2019, 18:35 - Andrew: that hostile rider earlier mainly
01/12/2019, 18:35 - Andrew: and I've had some long waits
01/12/2019, 18:41 - Molly: That sucks
01/12/2019, 18:41 - Molly: Have you made dollar tho
01/12/2019, 19:01 - Andrew: 65 so far

01/12/2019, 20:14 - Andrew: or worse
01/12/2019, 20:15 - Molly: I don't know. Everyone was coughing last night. I came home, slept, and when I woke up I felt terrible
01/12/2019, 20:15 - Molly: My throat is killing me
01/12/2019, 20:16 - Molly: I have exam on Tuesday. I can't get tonsillitis now
01/12/2019, 20:24 - Andrew: lets hope it's just a cold or sore throat
01/12/2019, 20:24 - Andrew: unless someone had tonsilitus last night
01/12/2019, 20:26 - Molly: No way if knowing
01/12/2019, 20:29 - Andrew: i guess you will find out tomorrow morning
01/12/2019, 20:29 - Andrew: get plenty of sleep
01/12/2019, 20:30 - Andrew: sleep is the best medicine
01/12/2019, 20:30 - Andrew: or medicine is
01/12/2019, 20:41 - Molly: I'm trying my best. Lotsa herbal tea
01/12/2019, 21:09 - Andrew: nice
01/12/2019, 21:09 - Andrew: i wish i had some
01/12/2019, 21:09 - Andrew: something with no caffeine for the evenings
01/12/2019, 21:16 - Molly: Oh I drink a lot of herbal tea. I'll get you some
02/12/2019, 12:32 - Andrew: aw thankyou
02/12/2019, 12:32 - Andrew: i'm on the coffee today
02/12/2019, 12:32 - Andrew: whilst I test the website that sells watches
02/12/2019, 12:41 - Molly: Green tea also has a lot of caffeine. I'm a big fan üòä
02/12/2019, 12:42 - Andrew: i drank a lot of green tea a while ago
02/12/2019, 12:42 - Andrew: earl grey feels like it has more oomph
02/12/2019, 12:42 - Andrew: earl grey without milk is pretty nice
02/12/2019, 12:43 - Molly: Just as much caffeine as tea, but oolong (earl grey) taste stronger. If you have it without milk, put some lemon in it, it's super nice
02/12/2019, 12:43 - Molly: I'm on the chai tea today
02/12/2019, 16:51 - Andrew: one of the staff at greggs gave me a mince pie üéÑ

02/12/2019, 20:01 - Molly: Wait not that
02/12/2019, 20:01 - Molly: I actually don't know
02/12/2019, 20:02 - Molly: It just hurts a lot
02/12/2019, 20:13 - Andrew: your sinuses?
02/12/2019, 20:14 - Molly: Yeah. But it's not a cold. Definitely a virus tho
02/12/2019, 20:15 - Andrew: üò∂
02/12/2019, 20:17 - Molly: What does that mean
02/12/2019, 20:19 - Andrew: it was all i could type before getting an order
02/12/2019, 20:19 - Andrew: but to elaborate
02/12/2019, 20:19 - Andrew: that sucks
02/12/2019, 20:20 - Andrew: and can you work do you think?

02/12/2019, 20:22 - Molly: I'm also gonna sleep as much as possible
02/12/2019, 20:22 - Molly: You might catch my illness
02/12/2019, 20:22 - Andrew: on a scale of 1 to 10 how bad is it
02/12/2019, 20:23 - Andrew: in case i get it
02/12/2019, 20:24 - Molly: Give me a relative
02/12/2019, 20:24 - Molly: 1 being what?
02/12/2019, 20:32 - Andrew: runny nose
02/12/2019, 20:32 - Andrew: light headache
02/12/2019, 20:32 - Andrew: full blown flu being 10
02/12/2019, 20:38 - Molly: Solid 5. It's survivable. But it's hard to think straight. Not messy like a cold, but very intense headache and swollen throat
02/12/2019, 20:40 - Andrew: damn
02/12/2019, 20:41 - Andrew: I'm quite confident I have a good immune system
02/12/2019, 20:42 - Molly: I only caught it cuz I was drinking
02/12/2019, 20:42 - Andrew: how do you mean
02/12/2019, 21:01 - Andrew: i'm home now
02/12/2019, 21:01 - Molly: Like my immune system was vulnerable
02/12/2019, 21:01 - Andrew: oh right
02/12/2019, 21:01 - Andrew: surely you'd have caught it even if you weren't drinking
02/12/2019, 21:01 - Andrew: i guess we'll never know
02/12/2019, 21:01 - Andrew: i'll come and see you tomorrow but i'll be testing from about 11am to 3pm
02/12/2019, 21:02 - Molly: Dunno. My immune system likes to crash completely sometimes. Especially when I'm stressed
02/12/2019, 21:02 - Molly: Okay. I'll text you when I wake up
02/12/2019, 21:03 - Molly: But I'm going to meet marilou for four
02/12/2019, 21:03 - Andrew: ah
02/12/2019, 21:04 - Andrew: it's just that kate is ringing me at 11am to explain the testing i'm going to be doing and 3pm is usually when i'm done by each day
02/12/2019, 21:05 - Molly: It's okay. I'll tell you how it goes after
02/12/2019, 21:06 - Andrew: could bring you a hotel breakfast at 1015?
02/12/2019, 21:09 - Molly: Sure, but does that give you time?
02/12/2019, 21:17 - Andrew: i could say 1130 instead to kate
02/12/2019, 21:23 - Molly: No it's okay honey. Don't stress about it
02/12/2019, 21:24 - Andrew: ok then
02/12/2019, 21:25 - Andrew: well when I finish tomorrow if I have time i can come see you
02/12/2019, 21:25 - Molly: I wanna see you of course, don't doubt. I just don't want you to feel pressured
02/12/2019, 21:25 - Andrew: i know you want to see me :)
02/12/2019, 21:26 - Andrew: i'll find time tomorrow!
02/12/2019, 21:29 - Molly: Okay honey
02/12/2019, 21:44 - Andrew: i'm unwinding watching a video about rebranding tampons
02/12/2019, 21:44 - Andrew: it's really good
02/12/2019, 21:45 - Molly: I'm interested. Go on
02/12/2019, 21:45 - Andrew: https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCvoKIJfodk4IhNAAjrBfx-g
02/12/2019, 21:46 - Andrew: she's a graphic designer, has done videos about how she would rebrand fanta, sprite, cheetos, things like that
02/12/2019, 21:47 - Andrew: and her most recent one is how she would rebrand playtex tampons to be a bit more inclusive. i.e. not mainly pink branding or feminine symbols
02/12/2019, 21:48 - Andrew: makes me want to make a moodboard for things to try on websites or for art work for music that i want to make
02/12/2019, 21:51 - Andrew: you and her both like cats and naps apparently
02/12/2019, 21:55 - Molly: That sounds so cool
02/12/2019, 21:56 - Andrew: she has lots of other videos but I mainly like her design ones
02/12/2019, 21:57 - Andrew: got me really interested in colours and designs and logos n shit yo
02/12/2019, 21:59 - Molly: You should get into graphic design
02/12/2019, 22:00 - Andrew: yeah i find it interesting
02/12/2019, 22:00 - Andrew: mainly how i can make websites look better
02/12/2019, 22:00 - Andrew: and probably simple art and symbols for my music
02/12/2019, 22:01 - Andrew: i think i need to get in the habit of drawing together images and art i like
02/12/2019, 22:01 - Andrew: i usually see cool stuff then forget where I saw it
02/12/2019, 22:07 - Molly: I didn't know you draw
02/12/2019, 22:12 - Andrew: i don't
02/12/2019, 22:13 - Andrew: *bring together
02/12/2019, 22:13 - Andrew: bringing**
02/12/2019, 22:16 - Molly: Sounds like drawing!
02/12/2019, 22:16 - Andrew: I'm terrible at drawing
02/12/2019, 22:17 - Andrew: well I've not done it since year 9
02/12/2019, 22:17 - Andrew: I'm sure with practice I'd be less terrible
02/12/2019, 22:26 - Molly: Maybe I could help you
02/12/2019, 23:00 - Andrew: hang on a minute
02/12/2019, 23:00 - Andrew: ü§î
02/12/2019, 23:00 - Andrew: maybe you could ü§î
03/12/2019, 11:57 - Molly: Had the worst nights sleep. Managed to eat some porridge. I feel terrible. How's work?
03/12/2019, 11:58 - Andrew: kate hasn't rung me yet üòë
03/12/2019, 11:58 - Andrew: i'm doing some stuff on my website though and putting some applications in
03/12/2019, 11:58 - Andrew: you should definitely try to nap before your exam
03/12/2019, 11:59 - Molly: Ugh that's annoying. Well done for the other stuff
03/12/2019, 11:59 - Andrew: kate forgets a lot
03/12/2019, 11:59 - Molly: I'll try. I'm gonna have a super hot shower in a min. That's supposed to help
03/12/2019, 11:59 - Andrew: but oh well i can be productive in other ways, should ring mum really
03/12/2019, 12:00 - Andrew: i hope you feel better soon :(
03/12/2019, 12:12 - Molly: Thanks baby
03/12/2019, 12:13 - Andrew: are you feeling confident about the test?
03/12/2019, 12:37 - Molly: Not really. I don't know how I'm going to concentrate
03/12/2019, 13:40 - Andrew: I'm sure you will pull through:)
03/12/2019, 13:40 - Andrew: you are really good at bsl
03/12/2019, 13:40 - Andrew: is it like a conversational test?
03/12/2019, 13:41 - Andrew: like signing answers to questions
03/12/2019, 14:29 - Molly: Thanks hun but for this one, it's pure concentration. Someone on a video signs a story at you for 20 mins. Then they ask questions about the story, but even that's in sign. You only get one chance to watch the video, so can't miss a thing
03/12/2019, 14:34 - Andrew: 20 mins!
03/12/2019, 14:34 - Andrew: eeurgh
03/12/2019, 14:34 - Andrew: sounds rather tough
03/12/2019, 14:35 - Molly: Yeah it super is
03/12/2019, 14:36 - Molly: Sometimes it comes down to memory. Especially if there's numbers and names involved
03/12/2019, 14:37 - Molly: Like was her son's name a. Jimmy b.jonny c.jimmi d.johny
03/12/2019, 14:37 - Molly: Like fuk
03/12/2019, 15:12 - Andrew: (Media Omitted)
03/12/2019, 16:17 - Molly: Thanks honey. Just made it to the library. Still feel terrible. On the drugs
03/12/2019, 16:45 - Andrew: more drugs!
03/12/2019, 16:45 - Andrew: you'll be fine dear :)
03/12/2019, 18:02 - Andrew: good luck!
03/12/2019, 18:02 - Andrew: I assume the exam starts soon
03/12/2019, 18:05 - Molly: Yes very soon. But I'm second sitting, so I gotta wait for a while
03/12/2019, 18:05 - Andrew: more time to cram
03/12/2019, 18:05 - Andrew: ü§ì
03/12/2019, 18:07 - Andrew: deep breaths
03/12/2019, 18:07 - Andrew: u can do it

03/12/2019, 18:55 - Andrew: starting soon?
03/12/2019, 20:47 - Molly: Ugh invigilator was 45 mins late and spent entire time on phone. I could've easily cheated
03/12/2019, 20:47 - Molly: But it's over now. I feel okay
03/12/2019, 20:50 - Andrew: reckon you passed it then?
03/12/2019, 20:51 - Molly: Yeh I was unsure, but we all talked after and said the same thing. But we also agreef the questions were super unfair
03/12/2019, 20:52 - Andrew: well it's good you all seemed to agree on that
03/12/2019, 20:52 - Molly: We had to remember numbers a d colours in correct orders. Nothing to do with sign, just bullshit
03/12/2019, 20:52 - Andrew: comforting solidarity
03/12/2019, 20:52 - Molly: Yeh true
03/12/2019, 20:52 - Molly: I want chips

03/12/2019, 20:56 - Andrew: sure, i'll go to papa g now
03/12/2019, 20:56 - Molly: I'll sleep at 10 I guess but like actually go sleep

03/12/2019, 21:14 - Molly: Me too. But I am very blurry eyed. The amphetamine just wore off, which is why I'm so tired and hungry
03/12/2019, 21:15 - Andrew: mmm amphetamine

04/12/2019, 09:28 - Molly: Nah if you had it, you'd know. Trust me. It hurt so bad
04/12/2019, 09:51 - Andrew: i'll assume i've avoided catching it then :D
04/12/2019, 09:51 - Andrew: also i've found a new pair of gear shifters for 16 quid onlinee

04/12/2019, 12:28 - Andrew: i needed a discount card to get that price i saw
04/12/2019, 12:28 - Andrew: which felt misleading
04/12/2019, 12:29 - Andrew: so waited ages on the customer service line for them to tell me yeah i did definitely need one
04/12/2019, 12:29 - Andrew: so bought the card and gloves

04/12/2019, 21:07 - Molly: Are you mad at me
04/12/2019, 21:07 - Andrew: no!

04/12/2019, 21:09 - Molly: I'm sorry
04/12/2019, 21:09 - Molly: Im being rude
04/12/2019, 21:09 - Andrew: no sorry
04/12/2019, 21:09 - Andrew: you're not being rude
04/12/2019, 21:10 - Andrew: maybe our typing is very quickfire and not so expressive as normal
04/12/2019, 21:10 - Molly: No it's me
04/12/2019, 21:10 - Andrew: and it just looks a bit off
04/12/2019, 21:10 - Molly: I'm messing up
04/12/2019, 21:10 - Molly: Sorry
04/12/2019, 21:10 - Andrew: no you're not
04/12/2019, 21:10 - Molly: I'm gonna go to sleep
04/12/2019, 21:10 - Andrew: ok dear
04/12/2019, 21:10 - Andrew: have you recovered btw?
04/12/2019, 21:10 - Molly: ???
04/12/2019, 21:11 - Molly: I'm okay
04/12/2019, 21:11 - Molly: Do you usually call me dear?
04/12/2019, 21:11 - Andrew: well, rarely i guess
04/12/2019, 21:11 - Molly: My brain feels scattered
04/12/2019, 21:12 - Andrew: want a quick call?
04/12/2019, 21:15 - Molly: No it won't be pretty. I just gotta assume I'm having an episode
04/12/2019, 21:16 - Andrew: ok, well i'm here if you want to talk
04/12/2019, 21:18 - Molly: Episode is like you perceive that you're being threatened/abandoned ect and you gotta acknowledge that it's not real. But it's super hard not to be like 'im not having an episode. That person is actually mad at me'
04/12/2019, 21:18 - Molly: So if you say you're not, j gotta believe this is episode
04/12/2019, 21:18 - Molly: It's hard to get past it though
04/12/2019, 21:19 - Andrew: i can come round for a bit if you'd like?
04/12/2019, 21:19 - Andrew: if it would make you feel better before sleep
04/12/2019, 21:19 - Molly: I kinda think youre keeping something from me. And that's not gonna go away
04/12/2019, 21:20 - Molly: I will be better tomorrow. Too many thoughts going through my head. I don't wanna say something I'll regret
04/12/2019, 21:20 - Molly: Goodnight honey. Thanks for understanding. I truly hope you're not actually mad at me
04/12/2019, 21:20 - Andrew: what do you mean?
04/12/2019, 21:20 - Andrew: i'm not mad at you
04/12/2019, 21:21 - Andrew: well if I did come round I would want you to feel as comfortable as possible
04/12/2019, 21:21 - Andrew: and we could've watched some antm with tea
04/12/2019, 21:21 - Molly: Like I'm paranoid I guess. But if I could tell that the paranoia was unjustified then I wouldn't be paranoid
04/12/2019, 21:21 - Molly: I won't settle
04/12/2019, 21:22 - Molly: Does that make sense
04/12/2019, 21:22 - Molly: I'll just keep asking why you're mad at me and j won't believe you're not hiding something
04/12/2019, 21:22 - Andrew: it makes sense, i don't feel that way very often so I don't know what it's like
04/12/2019, 21:23 - Molly: But I can also recognise the signs of an episode
04/12/2019, 21:23 - Molly: I'm two separate people rn
04/12/2019, 21:23 - Molly: Not literally
04/12/2019, 21:23 - Molly: I'm not insane
04/12/2019, 21:23 - Andrew: i know you're not insane :P
04/12/2019, 21:23 - Molly: I've really over done it. I'm sorry
04/12/2019, 21:23 - Molly: I hope you don't think less of me
04/12/2019, 21:24 - Andrew: genuinely i don't mind
04/12/2019, 21:24 - Andrew: i could come and see you after work tomorrow if you'd like
04/12/2019, 21:26 - Molly: I'm hoping it'll gone by then
04/12/2019, 21:26 - Andrew: if not then some cheese dippers might help üåù
04/12/2019, 21:26 - Molly: No I'm fat
04/12/2019, 21:26 - Molly: Fuk
04/12/2019, 21:27 - Molly: I need to stop talking
04/12/2019, 21:27 - Molly: I'm getting worked up
04/12/2019, 21:27 - Molly: It's not your fault
04/12/2019, 21:27 - Andrew: that's ok
04/12/2019, 21:27 - Andrew: typing is crap sometimes
04/12/2019, 21:27 - Andrew: like it's hard to get tone across
04/12/2019, 21:29 - Molly: Yeh
04/12/2019, 21:29 - Molly: Goodnight
04/12/2019, 21:29 - Andrew: goodnight x

05/12/2019, 12:05 - Molly: Stressful little fukers
05/12/2019, 12:05 - Molly: How are the websites
05/12/2019, 12:05 - Andrew: buggy little fukers
05/12/2019, 12:06 - Andrew: probably about 15+ hours of work this one
05/12/2019, 12:08 - Molly: Do you get paid by the hour
05/12/2019, 12:08 - Andrew: yeah it's min wage
05/12/2019, 12:09 - Andrew: I leave my timer running when i go to the loo or make a tea üòâ
05/12/2019, 12:13 - Molly: (Media Omitted)
05/12/2019, 12:14 - Molly: Same. I fill kettle to full with cold water. The longer it takes, the more free money
05/12/2019, 12:15 - Andrew: that's a good one
05/12/2019, 12:16 - Andrew: urgh this is a big job
05/12/2019, 12:16 - Andrew: so much to log
05/12/2019, 12:16 - Molly: I text you a lot, but the spreadsheet is on my phone, so no one can question it
05/12/2019, 12:16 - Molly: Sounds boring babe
05/12/2019, 12:18 - Molly: When you get frustrated or bored, go walk down the rd and back again
05/12/2019, 12:18 - Molly: I walk across the warehouse, pretend to stare thoughtfully at some stock and go back again
05/12/2019, 12:22 - Andrew: i think i will stare thoughtfully at some memes
05/12/2019, 12:22 - Andrew: and half-heartedly do some pushups
05/12/2019, 12:23 - Andrew: what a life
05/12/2019, 12:23 - Molly: Wish I could do that
05/12/2019, 12:27 - Andrew: i think it's time for a meme break now actually :)
05/12/2019, 12:28 - Molly: How long have you been going today
05/12/2019, 12:28 - Andrew: timer says 2h10m
05/12/2019, 12:30 - Molly: Not too bad
05/12/2019, 12:31 - Molly: I've been here near 6 hours
05/12/2019, 12:41 - Andrew: oof
05/12/2019, 12:42 - Andrew: and a bloody long commute
05/12/2019, 12:42 - Molly: It's okay actually. Going kinda fast. I'm really busy and spent the morning listening to new dnd episode
05/12/2019, 12:42 - Molly: But yeh the drive sucks
05/12/2019, 12:42 - Molly: I think I'm just relieved to feel well again
05/12/2019, 12:45 - Molly: I'm tempted to work late
05/12/2019, 12:48 - Andrew: to avoid rush hour?
05/12/2019, 12:49 - Molly: It won't make a difference. Traffic will be bad no matter what, so I might as well. And then I can leave early tomorrow
05/12/2019, 12:55 - Andrew: sucks :(
05/12/2019, 12:55 - Andrew: yeah probz worth it for an earlier friday finish
05/12/2019, 12:55 - Andrew: i think i need another meme break
05/12/2019, 12:56 - Molly: Btw should I bring bike and stuff tomorrow evening so we can go off straight away Saturday
05/12/2019, 14:12 - Andrew: good idea
05/12/2019, 14:12 - Andrew: straight away but around 11ish :P
05/12/2019, 14:14 - Molly: What's with you and 11ish
05/12/2019, 14:14 - Molly: Oh you want cooked breakfast!!
05/12/2019, 14:15 - Andrew: it's just a habit from when my ibs was bad, don't like being far from a toilet in the morning
05/12/2019, 14:15 - Andrew: and the route we're taking is just a long path
05/12/2019, 14:15 - Andrew: so not near restaurants like I am when i deliveroo in the mornings
05/12/2019, 14:28 - Molly: Ah okay I understand üòä
05/12/2019, 16:08 - Andrew: also I ate loads of veg and fruit yesterday
05/12/2019, 16:09 - Andrew: and remembered today why I don't routinely do that
05/12/2019, 16:09 - Andrew: been to the loo quite a lot üò∂
05/12/2019, 16:18 - Molly: Yeh but if you get used to it, it wouldn't be so bad. And it depends on the actual fruit and veg
05/12/2019, 16:20 - Andrew: usually it's apples, berries
05/12/2019, 16:20 - Andrew: and then potatoes, parsnips, carrots, all roasted
05/12/2019, 16:21 - Andrew: need more cruciferous vegetables, don't think they affect me so badly
05/12/2019, 16:24 - Molly: Yeah that's a lota root vegetables honey. They'll do that
05/12/2019, 16:24 - Molly: And then acidic fruit will upset your tummy so it won't work properly
05/12/2019, 16:25 - Molly: Not all cruciferous veggies work well either. Just keep a balance
05/12/2019, 16:25 - Molly: Jesus I hate that word btw
05/12/2019, 16:25 - Andrew: yeah i usually do have a variety of veg each sitting
05/12/2019, 16:25 - Andrew: and not so much fruit each day
05/12/2019, 16:26 - Andrew: i just feel best when i eat loads of meat unfortunately
05/12/2019, 16:31 - Molly: Well yeh because that's less effort to process
05/12/2019, 16:31 - Molly: Fish is good
05/12/2019, 16:31 - Molly: We should have fish tomorrow
05/12/2019, 16:32 - Molly: What is dinner plan?
05/12/2019, 16:44 - Andrew: roast veg with fish?
05/12/2019, 16:44 - Andrew: got plenty of potatoes and carrots
05/12/2019, 16:45 - Molly: Sure. I'll pick up some fish on my way home? Salmon?
05/12/2019, 16:46 - Molly: I won't have potatoes tho btw but make enough for yourself
05/12/2019, 16:49 - Molly: This is tomorrow btw right?

05/12/2019, 16:51 - Andrew: i have parsnips and sprouts to roast too
05/12/2019, 16:58 - Molly: I mean, are you sure. That won't help your problems
05/12/2019, 16:59 - Andrew: sprouts are ok
05/12/2019, 17:00 - Molly: They're famous for exactly that, aren't they?
05/12/2019, 17:09 - Andrew: apparently they are
05/12/2019, 17:09 - Andrew: but they give me no trouble
05/12/2019, 17:10 - Molly: Huh. That's strange
05/12/2019, 19:17 - Andrew: (Media Omitted)

05/12/2019, 21:31 - Andrew: and rather cold
05/12/2019, 21:34 - Molly: When do you want me to come round?
05/12/2019, 21:34 - Andrew: how about for 7.30pm?
05/12/2019, 21:35 - Molly: You don't need time after work?
05/12/2019, 21:35 - Andrew: nah not really

05/12/2019, 21:37 - Andrew: i'll get some broccoli tomorrow and we can roast it with the carrots
05/12/2019, 21:42 - Molly: Okay. Sounds good. I'm eating super healthy now. So if you get extras, count me out
05/12/2019, 21:42 - Andrew: ok then
05/12/2019, 21:43 - Andrew: we should stop enabling bad eating habits i guess
05/12/2019, 21:43 - Andrew: do you want any fruit?
05/12/2019, 21:43 - Andrew: i've got raspberries and blueberries
05/12/2019, 21:44 - Molly: For breakfast? Or for desert
05/12/2019, 21:44 - Andrew: both
05/12/2019, 21:44 - Andrew: how about apple slices with peanut butter for dipping
05/12/2019, 21:45 - Molly: 200 calories
05/12/2019, 21:46 - Molly: And that's gonna bother you. I'm gonna point out calories of everything
05/12/2019, 21:46 - Molly: I'll get some more berries tomorrow. They're low. I'm super on it atm
05/12/2019, 21:47 - Molly: But I can get you some apples
05/12/2019, 21:47 - Andrew: (Media Omitted)
05/12/2019, 21:47 - Andrew: no don't worry about the apples, i'll get some from the fruit market, they're super tasty
05/12/2019, 21:47 - Molly: Nice
05/12/2019, 21:48 - Molly: Do you like grapefruit?
05/12/2019, 21:49 - Andrew: yeah it's nice
05/12/2019, 21:49 - Molly: Holy shit I just tried to spell grapefruit, and realized I have been saying gratefruit my entire life and no one has corrected me
05/12/2019, 21:49 - Andrew: i like most fruits
05/12/2019, 21:49 - Molly: Im so mad
05/12/2019, 21:49 - Andrew: a GRATEFRUIT!?
05/12/2019, 21:50 - Andrew: üòÆüòÆ
05/12/2019, 21:50 - Molly: Honest to god. I was typing it in, wondering why it wasn't accepting it. I googled it and it auto corrected to grapefruit, and it was penny drop moment
05/12/2019, 21:50 - Andrew: how have you done that for so long
05/12/2019, 21:50 - Molly: Seriously I'm so fuked up rn
05/12/2019, 21:51 - Andrew: although it's a word I probably say about once a year
05/12/2019, 21:51 - Molly: Why is it grapefruit
05/12/2019, 21:51 - Andrew: shits fukd
05/12/2019, 21:51 - Molly: Grape
05/12/2019, 21:51 - Andrew: no clue

05/12/2019, 21:51 - Andrew: why do we say pineapple
05/12/2019, 21:51 - Andrew: haha
05/12/2019, 21:51 - Molly: And I thought it was gratefruit
05/12/2019, 21:51 - Andrew: well that makes it worse
05/12/2019, 21:51 - Molly: Why did no one tell me
05/12/2019, 21:52 - Andrew: maybe they think they misheard
05/12/2019, 21:52 - Andrew: or maybe everyone else doubted themselves
05/12/2019, 21:52 - Molly: I guess I don't pronounce t
05/12/2019, 21:52 - Andrew: and before they knew the conversation had moved on
05/12/2019, 21:53 - Molly: I guess. But have I never written it down
05/12/2019, 21:53 - Molly: Or seen it written?!
05/12/2019, 21:58 - Andrew: i never see it written
05/12/2019, 21:58 - Andrew: this is the most i've thought about that word ever really
05/12/2019, 21:58 - Andrew: maybe i'm mispronouncing things
05/12/2019, 21:58 - Andrew: üò∂
05/12/2019, 21:59 - Molly: Ah god, don't think about it
05/12/2019, 21:59 - Molly: I hear people pronounce art supplies wrong at work. Like, bitch we sell gesso, learn how to pronounce it
05/12/2019, 22:00 - Molly: Ochre is a fun one they like to fuk up
05/12/2019, 22:03 - Andrew: the fuck is gesso
05/12/2019, 22:03 - Andrew: is ochre pronounced like ock-rah?
05/12/2019, 22:03 - Andrew: or oaker
05/12/2019, 22:06 - Molly: You're worse than them
05/12/2019, 22:07 - Andrew: well i literally never say it
05/12/2019, 22:07 - Molly: Oaker
05/12/2019, 22:07 - Andrew: and i've heard both ways
05/12/2019, 22:07 - Molly: Ochre yellow. My favourite colour. Anyone saying ockrah is an idiot. End of
05/12/2019, 22:08 - Molly: And people always say guess-o
05/12/2019, 22:08 - Molly: It's like jesso
05/12/2019, 22:08 - Andrew: well how do you say almond?
05/12/2019, 22:08 - Molly: Almond

05/12/2019, 22:10 - Molly: All mond sounds American
05/12/2019, 22:11 - Molly: Who says arlmond
05/12/2019, 22:11 - Andrew: I probably say all or arl interchangeably
05/12/2019, 22:11 - Andrew: never al though
05/12/2019, 22:11 - Molly: Excuse me
05/12/2019, 22:12 - Molly: No you don't
05/12/2019, 22:12 - Andrew: pretty sure i mentioned this before
05/12/2019, 22:12 - Andrew: asking how you proncounced it
05/12/2019, 22:12 - Molly: Hang on. I might be reading that differently to you
05/12/2019, 22:12 - Andrew: all like the word all or arl like the jarl of whiterun
05/12/2019, 22:13 - Molly: Ok well now I'm saying yarlmond
05/12/2019, 22:13 - Molly: I guess like halfway between
05/12/2019, 22:14 - Molly: Ffs I can't remember how I say it now
05/12/2019, 22:14 - Andrew: no me neither
05/12/2019, 22:14 - Andrew: the word has lost all meaning
05/12/2019, 22:14 - Andrew: what are almond
05/12/2019, 22:15 - Molly: Damnit, need to sleep and I'm so worked up. Languages are the worst and my autocorrect is being broken. It's bad enough milkshake now corrects to milkdhakr

17/12/2019, 22:13 - Andrew: do you mind if we shop when i'm in my deliveroo clothes then we can walk to mine
17/12/2019, 22:14 - Molly: Yeh
17/12/2019, 22:14 - Andrew: yeah you mind?
17/12/2019, 22:14 - Molly: No I don't mind
17/12/2019, 22:14 - Andrew: rad
17/12/2019, 22:14 - Molly: But actually can I come over first
17/12/2019, 22:14 - Andrew: sure
17/12/2019, 22:15 - Andrew: whys that
17/12/2019, 22:15 - Molly: Okay. I'll see you tomorrow
17/12/2019, 22:15 - Molly: I just wanted to talk to you first
17/12/2019, 22:15 - Andrew: what is it?
17/12/2019, 22:16 - Molly: It's kinda about the other day
17/12/2019, 22:16 - Molly: I don't wanna argue, but I wanna talk openly about it
17/12/2019, 22:16 - Andrew: you can tell me now?
17/12/2019, 22:16 - Andrew: was it something I did?
17/12/2019, 22:17 - Molly: It might not translate well in text
17/12/2019, 22:17 - Andrew: what's it about?
17/12/2019, 22:17 - Molly: Ah god this is a whole discussion
17/12/2019, 22:18 - Molly: I'm not a fan of texting serious topics
17/12/2019, 22:18 - Andrew: yeah, text really isn't the best
17/12/2019, 22:19 - Andrew: can you tell me what it's about? I don't know exactly what you're referring to?
17/12/2019, 22:20 - Molly: Tbh I was pissed off when I left yours. And it helped me evaluate us more clearly. I don't think you intended to upset me, but it really showed me how we function and it worries me
17/12/2019, 22:20 - Andrew: can you elaborate?
17/12/2019, 22:20 - Molly: Oof okay hang on
17/12/2019, 22:21 - Molly: Okay I wrote down how I was feeling at the time. You wanna read that?
17/12/2019, 22:21 - Molly: It might be a little raw and in the moment
17/12/2019, 22:22 - Andrew: and i'll give you the benefit of the doubt since it's through text and it might come across differently, etc
17/12/2019, 22:22 - Andrew: when did I piss you off?
17/12/2019, 22:23 - Molly: You pretty much booted me out the house. Couldn't even finish my cuppa
17/12/2019, 22:23 - Molly: Hand on, big script coming
17/12/2019, 22:24 - Molly: After the other day, I went home feeling really bad. I know you didn't mean to but you really upset me, and it actually helped me think things through more clearly.
Our relationship revolves around food, sex and TV. I told you I didn't want to eat or have sex and it was like you were just bored of me. I'm scared to sleep over now because I feel like you think that means that sex will happen. I'm feeling stripped of my choice in the matter, because if I say no, and I don't want to eat either, then what is even left of us?

We have to admit our relationship has no real foundation. We have both said in the past, if this went long distance, we wouldn't bother. In fact, there are many scenarios where we would end this if it was too much effort. And to me, that's very sad. And it comes back to my issue that I can't seem to push past. I want passion, I want butterflies, and I want real unbreakable love. That's not something I'm just going to get over.
17/12/2019, 22:25 - Molly: I've been debating not saying anything because I just don't think it's worth the argument
17/12/2019, 22:29 - Andrew: it might take me a bit to write the kind of reply that I would be comfortable with
17/12/2019, 22:30 - Molly: That's okay. Take your time. I'm going to sleep honey. I sincerely hope you're not mad, and understand where I'm coming from. I truly don't want a fight. But I feel like if I let this feeling sit, it will only get worse
17/12/2019, 22:31 - Andrew: firstly
17/12/2019, 22:31 - Andrew: i'm not mad
17/12/2019, 22:31 - Andrew: and I'm not going to provoke an argument or shouting match or anything like that
17/12/2019, 22:31 - Molly: Okay thank you. I really appreciate that
17/12/2019, 22:33 - Andrew: and secondly thanks for telling me, i'm writing a reply now
17/12/2019, 22:33 - Molly: Okay. I'll read it tomorrow. Goodnight honey. Don't over think it. We'll talk in person tomorrow evening
18/12/2019, 00:24 - Andrew: Firstly, about the weekend, I‚Äôm really sorry that it looked like I was bored of you or was trying to boot you out; that‚Äôs not how I feel at all. I was embarrassed after asking you for sex and then remembering I had replied to you with ‚ÄúI‚Äôll just have a wank later then‚Äù just felt really stupid and tone-deaf. From what I remember, after I had said that, I was feeling slightly awkward and being neurotic. I apologise for coming across like that because I truly wasn‚Äôt annoyed at all. It horrifies me that you feel like you were stripped of having a choice anymore, I genuinely had no idea you felt like that!

I thought we were laying foundations, finding out about how the other person feels and thinks about things. Seeing you often feels totally natural. I do think about introducing you to my other friends and family and going away together, which feels normal to me at 2+ months in, but, I know you want something more passionate.  We have different expectations and outlooks and I‚Äôm not sure they are reconcilable.
18/12/2019, 00:28 - Andrew: I would rather talk in person in the morning, I can come to you
18/12/2019, 00:30 - Andrew: ok now I really will sleep, speak tomorrow
18/12/2019, 06:55 - Molly: Just got back from the gym. I didn't really sleep last night so I'm going to try to now. Can we talk in the evening. I'm going to my friends at 12 and I don't want to have to cut the conversation short
18/12/2019, 07:31 - Molly: (Media Omitted)
18/12/2019, 09:22 - Andrew: it's never poor timing for super nintendo chalmers
18/12/2019, 09:22 - Andrew: what time this evening?
18/12/2019, 12:48 - Molly: Over slept so bad. I'm just heading to Laura's now. I'll text when I'm heading back and see where you're at. It's an hour journey anyway
18/12/2019, 12:49 - Andrew: ok then, also unfortunately it looks like today me luke and lorn will be having our 3rd house chat but I will try and make it happen later in the evening
18/12/2019, 12:50 - Andrew: just to let you know
18/12/2019, 12:50 - Molly: Omg okay wow. Good luck. Just have it when you need to. I can wait
18/12/2019, 12:52 - Andrew: I can't keep you waiting!
18/12/2019, 12:52 - Molly: You just don't wanna do the house chat!
18/12/2019, 12:52 - Andrew: house drama meeting is less important anyway
18/12/2019, 12:53 - Molly: Okay. Talk soon
18/12/2019, 12:53 - Andrew: well it's true I don't want to do it, I have to though üëéüèº
18/12/2019, 15:22 - Molly: I'm heading back now. Should I come straight to you?
18/12/2019, 15:25 - Andrew: probably best not because Lorn is in, and I'm also seeing Niall soon
18/12/2019, 16:27 - Molly: Okay. Home now. Let me know when you're free
18/12/2019, 17:56 - Andrew: i will
18/12/2019, 19:37 - Andrew: is 8.20 ok?
18/12/2019, 19:40 - Molly: Are you coming to me?
18/12/2019, 19:44 - Andrew: yeah I'll be at yours in about 30 mins
18/12/2019, 19:46 - Molly: Okay
18/12/2019, 20:05 - Andrew: 3 mins away actually
18/12/2019, 20:08 - Molly: Kettle = on
18/12/2019, 20:08 - Andrew: im outside
25/12/2019, 10:05 - Andrew: merry christmas! üéÑ‚òÉ
25/12/2019, 10:05 - Andrew: hope you have a lovely day and eat loads :)
25/12/2019, 10:54 - Molly: Happy Christmas! Have a good one! ü•≥ü•≥ü•≥
25/12/2019, 19:04 - Andrew: oh and btw there was no housemate drama in the end, it was quite anticlimactic
25/12/2019, 19:45 - Molly: Boo. Boring!
25/12/2019, 21:24 - Andrew: (Media Omitted)
25/12/2019, 21:26 - Molly: She's so gorgeous! That little chin beard üòç
25/12/2019, 21:28 - Andrew: (Media Omitted)
25/12/2019, 21:29 - Molly: Hehe cat butt
25/12/2019, 21:42 - Andrew: yeah
25/12/2019, 21:42 - Andrew: loafing
01/01/2020, 00:09 - Andrew: happy new year!!üéâüéäüéâüéä
01/01/2020, 00:12 - Molly: Happy New year!!! ü•≥ü•≥ü•≥
18/04/2020, 21:11 - Andrew: Hey, long time no speak :) how are you holding up?
18/04/2020, 21:22 - Molly: Hey üòä I'm bored af. How are you?
18/04/2020, 21:22 - Andrew: same üòë
18/04/2020, 21:23 - Andrew: i'm not faring well in this post-apocalyptic hellscape
18/04/2020, 21:23 - Molly: Oh no
18/04/2020, 21:23 - Molly: Are you still doing deliveroo?
18/04/2020, 21:23 - Andrew: unfortunately yes, it's been difficult to make even min wage recently
18/04/2020, 21:24 - Andrew: I actually had a full-time job lined up... until about 3 weeks ago
18/04/2020, 21:25 - Andrew: the company that would've emplyed me lost 70% of their income overnight after Boris brought in the stricter measures, so I'm not going to be a junior web developer just yet :(
18/04/2020, 21:26 - Molly: Oh no oh no!! You were so close!!!
18/04/2020, 21:26 - Molly: Do you think you'll still get that job when this is all over?
18/04/2020, 21:27 - Andrew: they said they would if things go back to normal but I wouldn't be surprised if the company folds soon
18/04/2020, 21:28 - Andrew: but yes it was the worst possible timing for a pandemic ü§¶‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
18/04/2020, 21:28 - Molly: Ugh that's so unfair
18/04/2020, 21:28 - Molly: You're still healthy tho, right?
18/04/2020, 21:29 - Andrew: yes I'm healthy, i'm very sure i've had the virus already though
18/04/2020, 21:29 - Andrew: about a month ago now
18/04/2020, 21:29 - Andrew: have you caught it?
18/04/2020, 21:31 - Molly: That's great. Means you're all done üòä I don't know. My lungs hurt for a bit. Was that it??? Who knows ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è
18/04/2020, 21:34 - Andrew: guess none of us will know for a while!
18/04/2020, 21:34 - Andrew: niall however has had a terrible time with it
18/04/2020, 21:34 - Andrew: a few weeks ago he was so bad that dana had to call 111 three time over three nights
18/04/2020, 21:35 - Andrew: last night he had chest pains and felt unwell again, so an ambulance was sent for him :(
18/04/2020, 21:38 - Molly: That's awful! Is he okay?
18/04/2020, 21:39 - Andrew: he's doing ok now, the paramedics think it was his lungs recovering or chest muscles being weakened
18/04/2020, 21:39 - Andrew: i've been worrying about him a lot, it feels horrible
18/04/2020, 21:40 - Molly: Yeh I'm sure. At least it's nearly over for him now
18/04/2020, 21:41 - Molly: It would be so easy to be panicking all the time. But this might go on for the rest of the year
18/04/2020, 21:44 - Andrew: yeah everything sucks right now :(
18/04/2020, 21:44 - Andrew: how have you been for the last few weeks?
18/04/2020, 21:45 - Andrew: i'm living with only lorn so it's not accidentally optimal for me :P
18/04/2020, 21:46 - Molly: Wow, that must be a challenge. I like my housemates, but they are getting on my nerves. Can't imagine what you're going through
18/04/2020, 21:47 - Molly: Yeh it's okay for me. I'm bored. Not working. I'm exercising loads. Just can't find motivation to do anything useful. I miss people
18/04/2020, 21:48 - Andrew: yeah my motivation for coding and being productive has evaporated, it's been so long since i've even hugged someone :(
18/04/2020, 21:49 - Andrew: enjoy living with people you get on with! me and lorn barely talk and he seems to be drinking almost every night, poor guy is probably stressed or depressed or something
18/04/2020, 21:51 - Andrew: there's only so much piano I can play, even with all this free time
18/04/2020, 21:51 - Andrew: *harpsichord
18/04/2020, 21:53 - Molly: Ugh I think the sound of a harpsichord would make me kill someone rn!!
18/04/2020, 21:53 - Molly: Are you okay tho?
18/04/2020, 21:53 - Molly: Are you staying in contact with lots of people?
18/04/2020, 21:55 - Andrew: yeah I call my family most nights and video call friends a lot, we all do a pub quiz once a week :D
18/04/2020, 21:56 - Andrew: I just feel uneasy really, most of the time
18/04/2020, 21:56 - Molly: That actually sounds really fun
18/04/2020, 21:57 - Andrew: like i'm just trying to distract myself with something all the time, my parents can support me if needed though so it could be far worse for me
18/04/2020, 21:57 - Molly: Yeh I think that's the universal feeling
18/04/2020, 21:57 - Molly: That's good. Do you still see your parents?
18/04/2020, 21:58 - Andrew: I call my parents every other night atm
18/04/2020, 21:58 - Andrew: my sister is setting up a zoom call tomorrow for the whole family though
18/04/2020, 21:58 - Andrew: mega excited
18/04/2020, 21:59 - Molly: That's such a cute idea
18/04/2020, 21:59 - Andrew: i doubt i'll be seeing them face to face for quite a while
18/04/2020, 21:59 - Molly: Yeh that's smart
18/04/2020, 22:05 - Andrew: i've actually had a headache for a few hours that felt like the covid one
18/04/2020, 22:06 - Andrew: and i'm perhaps thinking I shouldn't have worked this evening
18/04/2020, 22:06 - Andrew: i'm thinking*
18/04/2020, 22:06 - Molly: Sure, but it could just be a headache
18/04/2020, 22:06 - Andrew: it could be the beer i drank last night or my failed nap earlier
18/04/2020, 22:06 - Molly: Yeh more likely
18/04/2020, 22:06 - Molly: Don't worry yourself
18/04/2020, 22:07 - Molly: Wait for a fever
18/04/2020, 22:07 - Andrew: i'm being a hypochondriac probably
18/04/2020, 22:07 - Molly: But if you're headachey. Maybe have some rest tomorrow
18/04/2020, 22:07 - Molly: Better safe than sorry
18/04/2020, 22:09 - Andrew: i've become very good at spending most of the day horizontal recently
18/04/2020, 22:10 - Andrew: could also just be that i've exercised a lot too
18/04/2020, 22:10 - Andrew: saw your run on strava btw :P
18/04/2020, 22:11 - Molly: Lying down, or way too active. There is no in-between
18/04/2020, 22:11 - Molly: Oh yeh. I got the challenge, and I'm stubborn
18/04/2020, 22:11 - Molly: Never done 5k before. Felt awful. Is that an okay time?
18/04/2020, 22:17 - Andrew: that's pretty darn good
18/04/2020, 22:17 - Andrew: if youv'e never done one before
18/04/2020, 22:19 - Molly: Thank you üòä
18/04/2020, 22:19 - Molly: I might keep at it. See if I get better
18/04/2020, 22:19 - Molly: Any tips?
18/04/2020, 22:19 - Andrew: i see many many runners at the moment, many who are clearly doing it for the first time :P
18/04/2020, 22:20 - Andrew: if your shins hurt when you run, stop running
18/04/2020, 22:20 - Andrew: that's it really, i had shin splints for 2 weeks once and it was hell
18/04/2020, 22:21 - Molly: I'm used to short runs on the treadmill. I'm super careful with bone stuff anyway. I think 5k is for sure my limit
18/04/2020, 22:22 - Molly: Sorry about us gym lot out in mass. They closed the gyms like a month ago
18/04/2020, 22:24 - Andrew: you'll be doing 10k before you know it
18/04/2020, 22:24 - Andrew: so many runners in massive baggy t shirts and old trainers looking a bit lost
18/04/2020, 22:26 - Molly: Ah yes. My people
18/04/2020, 22:26 - Molly: We are always lost
18/04/2020, 22:29 - Andrew: anything to prevent a #quarantinebod
18/04/2020, 22:30 - Andrew: i have apples with peanut butter on way too often now
18/04/2020, 22:30 - Andrew: that's your doing :P
18/04/2020, 22:37 - Molly: Oh man I miss that. It's the best. Haven't been buying apples recently
18/04/2020, 22:45 - Andrew: do you still go to asda?
18/04/2020, 22:45 - Andrew: it actually feels pretty normal
18/04/2020, 22:46 - Andrew: reminds me of simpler timer, like february
18/04/2020, 22:47 - Molly: Sometimes. But I can't bring the car, so gotta ration a little. Apples are slightly less import
18/04/2020, 22:47 - Molly: I miss February
18/04/2020, 22:48 - Andrew: i miss seeing friends and going out
18/04/2020, 22:48 - Andrew: the quiet roads are nice though
18/04/2020, 22:49 - Andrew: not really worth it when thousands are dying though
18/04/2020, 22:49 - Molly: No, but it's good to enjoy the little things
18/04/2020, 22:49 - Molly: Anyway. I have a zoom meeting scheduled tomorrow morning with the fam
18/04/2020, 22:49 - Molly: Talk soon. Sleep well xx
18/04/2020, 22:50 - Andrew: you too xx i should go to sleep too, i've had a long day of doing fack all :)
20/04/2020, 19:03 - Molly: How does one take keys, phone ect running, when clothing companies refuse to put pockets on sports clothing! I mean. Forget bringing a water bottle
20/04/2020, 19:07 - Andrew: you can get running leggings that have a phone holder on the back
20/04/2020, 19:08 - Andrew: but my low tech solution is just wrap a neck warmer around my wrist and slot my phone in and it holds it
20/04/2020, 19:08 - Molly: That's a risky game!
20/04/2020, 19:08 - Molly: I have leggings with a pocket in the back, but it's crazy tiny. Wtf is it for
20/04/2020, 19:08 - Andrew: I know, at running club everyone has cool watches and i'm there holding my phone and keys
20/04/2020, 19:09 - Molly: Aw fuk. I don't wanna buy a crazy expensive watch
20/04/2020, 19:09 - Andrew: no, don't!
20/04/2020, 19:09 - Andrew: you don't need them
20/04/2020, 19:09 - Molly: Why has no one fixed this problem
20/04/2020, 19:09 - Molly: What about water?
20/04/2020, 19:10 - Andrew: I go without üê™
20/04/2020, 19:10 - Molly: I guess I will too. But in this heat, seems kinda silly
20/04/2020, 19:11 - Andrew: probably not the best time to use water fountains either
20/04/2020, 19:11 - Molly: Are there water fountains in Bristol?
20/04/2020, 19:12 - Andrew: https://www.amazon.co.uk/Ultimate-Performance-580ml-Running-Bottle/dp/B009HMZU3Y?ref_=fsclp_pl_dp_1

I would probably use something like this
20/04/2020, 19:12 - Andrew: ooh yes plenty
20/04/2020, 19:12 - Andrew: millennium square and queen square are the only ones I can bring to mind right now
20/04/2020, 19:14 - Molly: Oh shit, I'll remember that
20/04/2020, 19:15 - Molly: Just gonna tie a jumper round my waist and hope my phone stays in the pocket
20/04/2020, 19:15 - Molly: Wish me luck
20/04/2020, 19:15 - Andrew: you'll be fine!
20/04/2020, 19:15 - Andrew: worst case scenario just hold it
20/04/2020, 19:16 - Molly: Ugh yeh fine
20/04/2020, 19:16 - Andrew: how far you going? a cheeky half marathon?
20/04/2020, 19:16 - Andrew: :P
20/04/2020, 19:22 - Molly: It'll be a miracle if I make it down the street and back
20/04/2020, 19:26 - Andrew: godspeed üèÉüèº‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è
20/04/2020, 20:55 - Molly: I did it! ü•∞ Exact same time as before
20/04/2020, 20:56 - Molly: But it felt easier this time
20/04/2020, 20:56 - Molly: How was your bike ride btw?
20/04/2020, 20:57 - Andrew: excellent üëç
20/04/2020, 20:57 - Andrew: it was very windy
20/04/2020, 20:57 - Andrew: going east was horrible but west was lovely
20/04/2020, 20:58 - Molly: Are you working at the same time? Or is this your one a day exercise?
20/04/2020, 20:59 - Andrew: reached 71.6km/h going down one of the hills too which was mega fun
20/04/2020, 20:59 - Andrew: yeah I sometimes work in the evening
20/04/2020, 20:59 - Andrew: after running or riding
20/04/2020, 20:59 - Andrew: I usually put the work rides to private though :P
20/04/2020, 21:00 - Andrew: it's the same work moped riders do anyway
20/04/2020, 21:00 - Molly: You must be exercising so much! That's crazy
20/04/2020, 21:01 - Molly: Wtf that's like 45 mph
20/04/2020, 21:01 - Molly: Isn't that scary
20/04/2020, 21:01 - Andrew: nah it's a very straight line kind of descent
20/04/2020, 21:01 - Andrew: just make yourself more aerodynamic and hold the position
20/04/2020, 21:02 - Andrew: i would like to break 100km/h one day but it won't happen on the hills here, maybe somewhere in the pyrenees
20/04/2020, 21:03 - Molly: No! Too scary! You would die if you came off
20/04/2020, 21:04 - Andrew: lol if I don't get to attempt it I won't mind
20/04/2020, 21:04 - Andrew: i prefer going up hills anyway
20/04/2020, 21:04 - Andrew: I sound fun
20/04/2020, 21:05 - Molly: What is wrong with you
20/04/2020, 21:05 - Andrew: i like the pain
20/04/2020, 21:05 - Andrew: üåù
20/04/2020, 21:06 - Molly: Sadistic
20/04/2020, 21:06 - Andrew: and the hopeless feeling at the base of a huge steep hill
20/04/2020, 21:06 - Andrew: there's no escape and it's going to hurt
20/04/2020, 21:07 - Molly: WTF MAN
20/04/2020, 21:07 - Molly: That's awful
20/04/2020, 21:07 - Andrew: yeah but then it's eventually over
20/04/2020, 21:08 - Andrew: and you sometimes get a new view
20/04/2020, 21:08 - Andrew: nice*
20/04/2020, 21:09 - Molly: OR you can walk up like a sane person
20/04/2020, 21:11 - Andrew: but cycling is cooler
20/04/2020, 21:11 - Andrew: and i'm cool
20/04/2020, 21:11 - Andrew: I wear lycra
20/04/2020, 21:13 - Molly: Uuuugh
20/04/2020, 21:13 - Molly: Youre the worst
20/04/2020, 21:13 - Andrew: it's fun!
20/04/2020, 21:14 - Molly: The cycling or the lycra?
20/04/2020, 21:14 - Andrew: the cycling
20/04/2020, 21:14 - Andrew: the lycra isn't always necessary
20/04/2020, 21:14 - Andrew: but is if you want to go super quick
20/04/2020, 21:15 - Andrew: which is currently erryday
20/04/2020, 21:15 - Molly: You just want to look like an 80s music video
20/04/2020, 21:15 - Andrew: how did you know that no i don't shut up
20/04/2020, 21:17 - Molly: üòÇ lmao
20/04/2020, 21:21 - Andrew: (Media Omitted)
20/04/2020, 21:21 - Molly: Omg please don't
20/04/2020, 21:21 - Molly: That's way too much
20/04/2020, 21:21 - Molly: Stop
20/04/2020, 21:21 - Andrew: :D
20/04/2020, 21:22 - Andrew: before the pandemic I was running more than cycling anyway
20/04/2020, 21:23 - Andrew: feels weird to say "before the pandemic"
20/04/2020, 21:36 - Molly: I've been calling it The before times
20/04/2020, 21:37 - Molly: I guess that was the perfect time to be running more
20/04/2020, 21:39 - Andrew: before "the incident"
20/04/2020, 21:48 - Molly: Ground 0
20/04/2020, 21:48 - Molly: Day z
20/04/2020, 21:48 - Molly: The purge
20/04/2020, 21:56 - Andrew: kung flu
20/04/2020, 21:56 - Molly: No
20/04/2020, 21:57 - Molly: Terrible
20/04/2020, 21:57 - Andrew: bit of casual racism there
20/04/2020, 21:57 - Molly: Oof
20/04/2020, 21:57 - Andrew: or xenophobia even
20/04/2020, 21:57 - Molly: Why not both üëçüëç
20/04/2020, 21:57 - Andrew: üéäüéâ
20/04/2020, 21:59 - Andrew: niall has had a bad day again :(
20/04/2020, 21:59 - Molly: Oh no
20/04/2020, 21:59 - Andrew: sucks that I can't cycle over and see them both
20/04/2020, 21:59 - Molly: üòü
20/04/2020, 21:59 - Molly: Is it chest pain again?
20/04/2020, 22:00 - Andrew: that with anxiety
20/04/2020, 22:00 - Andrew: they don't go together well
20/04/2020, 22:00 - Molly: Of course
20/04/2020, 22:00 - Molly: He'll get through it
20/04/2020, 22:00 - Molly: He's not alone
20/04/2020, 22:01 - Andrew: i saw a bbc piece on what bergamo, italy is like right now
20/04/2020, 22:01 - Andrew: it's pretty grim
20/04/2020, 22:02 - Andrew: i think we're in the least affected UK region too
20/04/2020, 22:02 - Andrew: so there are worse places to have the virus
20/04/2020, 22:03 - Molly: Yes you're right. And if it gets really bad, you can go to hospital. You don't have to suffer at home
20/04/2020, 22:05 - Andrew: yeah that's true, i don't think my mum would do well with the virus
20/04/2020, 22:06 - Andrew: i think grandma would make it through, she's a tough as nails northern grandma
20/04/2020, 22:08 - Molly: Ah she'd be fine. It would take a tornado to take out a northern woman
20/04/2020, 22:09 - Andrew: the party for her 90th was going to be in june
20/04/2020, 22:09 - Andrew: highly doubt it will happen now though
20/04/2020, 22:10 - Molly: Probably not a good idea
20/04/2020, 22:17 - Andrew: it will be a looong time until I see her i'm sure
20/04/2020, 22:17 - Andrew: and my parents
20/04/2020, 22:17 - Molly: Yeh I feel the same
20/04/2020, 22:18 - Molly: It's sad
20/04/2020, 22:18 - Molly: Video chat isn't the same
20/04/2020, 22:20 - Andrew: funny watching my dad trying to get it to work though
20/04/2020, 22:21 - Andrew: while my sister both watch like üòë üòë
20/04/2020, 22:24 - Molly: Ahaha classic
20/04/2020, 22:24 - Molly: Boomers trying to learn zoom
20/04/2020, 22:28 - Andrew: mum is alright at it but dad always makes a song and dance about asking my mum to turn it on
20/04/2020, 22:29 - Andrew: both parents manage to look like potatoes by the way they position the camera
20/04/2020, 22:33 - Molly: Haha that's so funny
20/04/2020, 22:33 - Molly: My dad got upset when us kids were doing backgrounds and he couldn't work it out
20/04/2020, 22:33 - Molly: He got it eventually
20/04/2020, 22:34 - Molly: (Media Omitted)
20/04/2020, 22:41 - Andrew: WHY are there giant cats in the background
20/04/2020, 22:42 - Andrew: is this a zoom thing?
20/04/2020, 22:45 - Molly: Lmao yes
20/04/2020, 22:45 - Molly: It's our cats
20/04/2020, 22:46 - Andrew: aaw
20/04/2020, 22:46 - Molly: You can put any picture up
20/04/2020, 22:46 - Andrew: i'll need to find a good picture for the next family chat
20/04/2020, 22:46 - Molly: Yes, absolutely
20/04/2020, 22:46 - Molly: Make sure you have a clear background
20/04/2020, 22:47 - Molly: Anyway, talk soon. I am a big baby who needs sleep
20/04/2020, 22:47 - Molly: Night xx

21/04/2020, 20:42 - Andrew: we all know what will happen though
21/04/2020, 21:05 - Molly: I don't have tik tok. Is it an app? The links are full of ads
21/04/2020, 21:05 - Andrew: it's like vine
21/04/2020, 21:05 - Andrew: but is actually better, there's no video time limit
21/04/2020, 21:05 - Molly: But cringier, right?
21/04/2020, 21:05 - Andrew: my tiktok is 99% cats

24/04/2020, 19:21 - Andrew: who doesn't just put them in fresh water and see if they go up on their end?!
24/04/2020, 19:22 - Andrew: I inadvertently boiled a gone off egg once, then when I removed the shell I almost vomited
24/04/2020, 19:25 - Molly: Ooo fun

24/04/2020, 19:35 - Andrew: i wouldn't recommend it
24/04/2020, 19:36 - Andrew: nothing better than a free house and a piano :)))
24/04/2020, 19:44 - Molly: Uuugh but a real piano. I need a real piano
24/04/2020, 19:58 - Andrew: my landlady's one is good enough for me
24/04/2020, 19:58 - Andrew: way better than my actual piano at my parents house
24/04/2020, 19:59 - Molly: Your piano is actually quite nice
24/04/2020, 19:59 - Molly: But I'd kill to use a grande church one rn
24/04/2020, 20:00 - Andrew: yeah that would be really nice
24/04/2020, 20:00 - Andrew: all churches are closed üëé
24/04/2020, 20:00 - Andrew: my dad has taken to uploading facebook messages for his parishioners

28/04/2020, 17:33 - Andrew: have you not heard of ed balls day?!
28/04/2020, 17:34 - Molly: No, what
28/04/2020, 17:35 - Andrew: years ago, ed balls the politician accidentally tweeted his own name and left it up on twitter
28/04/2020, 17:36 - Molly: Lmao sounds about right
28/04/2020, 17:36 - Andrew: (Media Omitted)
28/04/2020, 17:36 - Molly: Perfect
28/04/2020, 17:36 - Molly: I love it
28/04/2020, 17:37 - Molly: And thank you btw. It's so much easier to run in the rain. I knocked 4 minutes off
28/04/2020, 18:04 - Andrew: speedy!
28/04/2020, 18:04 - Andrew: i like cooler temperatures for running
28/04/2020, 18:04 - Andrew: i would run today but my symptoms have come back üëé
28/04/2020, 18:05 - Molly: Symptoms?
28/04/2020, 18:05 - Andrew: covid symptoms
28/04/2020, 18:07 - Molly: I didn't know you had symptoms?
28/04/2020, 18:08 - Andrew: I had them last month and I was bedbound for a few days
28/04/2020, 18:09 - Andrew: about 5-6 weeks ago now
28/04/2020, 18:09 - Andrew: but it seems the symptoms can recur after a few weeks, usually not as severe
28/04/2020, 18:15 - Molly: Oh no. Are you breathing ok?
28/04/2020, 18:19 - Andrew: yeah my breathing is fine
28/04/2020, 18:20 - Andrew: but it feels like what I had last month but not as bad
28/04/2020, 18:21 - Andrew: and i'm eligible for a home test kit but they all get snapped up too quickly each morning
28/04/2020, 18:22 - Molly: What did you have?
28/04/2020, 18:22 - Andrew: would be grand if I could just know
28/04/2020, 18:22 - Andrew: last month?
28/04/2020, 18:22 - Molly: Why are you eligible?
28/04/2020, 18:22 - Andrew: i'm a key worker!
28/04/2020, 18:23 - Molly: Aaah I see. Honestly tho even doctors aren't taking the test. Even if you don't have it, any symptoms you should stay home
28/04/2020, 18:24 - Andrew: last month, I had fatigue, body aches, probably quite confused, persistent headache, easily light-headed. they were bad enough for two days to keep me in bed and I had to call 111 at one point
28/04/2020, 18:25 - Andrew: nowhere near as bad as niall's experience though
28/04/2020, 19:01 - Molly: Awh hun I'm so sorry you were so unwell. Stay hydrated. You're healthy, you'll be fine
28/04/2020, 19:02 - Molly: When the antibody test is available, you should take it
28/04/2020, 19:02 - Andrew: absolutely
28/04/2020, 19:02 - Andrew: a covid test right now would be great though :(
28/04/2020, 19:03 - Andrew: i'm not exactly top priority though
28/04/2020, 19:04 - Molly: Just get some rest
28/04/2020, 19:04 - Molly: It's important to get through this
28/04/2020, 19:06 - Andrew: (Media Omitted)
28/04/2020, 19:41 - Molly: But...you're isolated
28/04/2020, 19:41 - Andrew: ...with lorn
28/04/2020, 19:43 - Molly: Oh fun
30/04/2020, 14:42 - Molly: How are you feeling today?
30/04/2020, 14:58 - Andrew: not very well today unfortunately
30/04/2020, 14:59 - Andrew: the last 3 days I've felt pretty awful
30/04/2020, 15:04 - Molly: Oh no. Has it gotten worse?
30/04/2020, 15:06 - Andrew: I don't think so, but the symptoms come and go
30/04/2020, 15:06 - Andrew: often by the hour
30/04/2020, 15:06 - Andrew: it totally sucks
30/04/2020, 15:06 - Molly: Is it a fever? Fevers often do that. Are you drinking enough water?
30/04/2020, 15:07 - Andrew: yeah i'm drinking a lot
30/04/2020, 15:07 - Andrew: i don't feel particularly hot to the touch but then I don't often touch myself to check for temperature so i don't know what's warmer than usual
30/04/2020, 15:07 - Andrew: it does feel like a mild fever though, not as bad as last month
30/04/2020, 15:09 - Molly: Does your chest feel unusually hot, or does your skin feel clammy?
30/04/2020, 15:09 - Andrew: not really
30/04/2020, 15:09 - Molly: Are you sure it's covid and not something else?
30/04/2020, 15:09 - Andrew: i don't know for sure because I can't get tested
30/04/2020, 15:09 - Molly: It's very unlikely to have covid without a fever
30/04/2020, 15:10 - Molly: Hmmm
30/04/2020, 15:10 - Andrew: well it feels almost exactly like last month but milder
30/04/2020, 15:10 - Andrew: and recurring symptoms seem to be happening with covid
30/04/2020, 15:11 - Molly: This is the first I'm hearing that tbh
30/04/2020, 15:11 - Andrew: well this particular version is all brand new and i've only heard stories
30/04/2020, 15:12 - Andrew: niall is going through his second bout of symptoms right now
30/04/2020, 15:12 - Andrew: the doctor he saw recently said she's seen symptoms return in people
30/04/2020, 15:12 - Molly: It's a virus, so you shouldn't be getting reinfected unless you have an immunity problem. But I guess we don't know everything about it yet
30/04/2020, 15:13 - Andrew: who knows ehü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
30/04/2020, 15:13 - Molly: If you stress too much, your immune system will dip. So just try not to get anxious. you're gonna be fine anyway
30/04/2020, 15:13 - Andrew: apparently some people felt the effects of SARS from the last decade up to 3 years after!
30/04/2020, 15:14 - Molly: Well this is Sars, so I guess that makes sense. Could be caused by trauma, and not infection tho. Who fukin knows
30/04/2020, 15:15 - Molly: If you're coming into contact with lots of people when you deliver, you're clearly far more exposed
30/04/2020, 15:15 - Andrew: the virus could've potentially not been fully eradicated during my first symptoms
30/04/2020, 15:15 - Andrew: yeah definitely
30/04/2020, 15:16 - Andrew: about 5-6 days before I had my worst symptoms last month, I had gone into about 15 restaurants all over bristol
30/04/2020, 15:16 - Andrew: a few were those small shipping container restaurants at whapping wharf
30/04/2020, 15:17 - Andrew: and you're basically smushed up against people when they're busy :P
30/04/2020, 15:18 - Molly: Virus kinda never leave you tho. They alter your DNA.
Oh boy, that's worrying. I'm not surprised tho. Every time I order food, I know I'm taking a big risk. It would only take one person in the chain to have it
30/04/2020, 15:19 - Andrew: asda feels like the biggest risk at the moment, yet i actually enjoy the relative normalness of shopping there
30/04/2020, 15:21 - Andrew: i usually take the food out of the packaging onto a plate then throw the packaging then wash hands again
30/04/2020, 15:22 - Andrew: which is all well and good but my skin has been so cracked and dry recently that they look about 60 years old
30/04/2020, 15:23 - Andrew: i should carry my e45 around with me on a necklace or something
30/04/2020, 16:23 - Molly: Awh sweetie, you're being so careful. I'm sorry this is so difficult
30/04/2020, 16:24 - Andrew: i have been moaning to people about it recently, but it's all been quite manageable really
30/04/2020, 16:24 - Andrew: mum and dad can support me for a while anyway ü§ô
30/04/2020, 16:25 - Molly: Yeh health is more important than money. Stay safe
03/05/2020, 12:55 - Molly: Hey, how are you feeling?
03/05/2020, 12:56 - Andrew: pretty good now
03/05/2020, 12:56 - Andrew: best i've felt for about a week and a half
03/05/2020, 12:57 - Andrew: this has been worse than flu
03/05/2020, 12:57 - Molly: That's a relief to hear. Make sure you still rest until you're all the way better
03/05/2020, 12:57 - Molly: Yeh apparently men feel it bad
03/05/2020, 12:57 - Andrew: i'm craving some fresh air so i'm going for a walk in a bit
03/05/2020, 12:57 - Molly: That's a good idea
03/05/2020, 12:58 - Andrew: i had a voice call with my family about an hour ago and my voice and social skills were definitely worse than usual ‚òπÔ∏è
03/05/2020, 12:59 - Andrew: video*
03/05/2020, 12:59 - Andrew: as I have barely said anything for a week
03/05/2020, 12:59 - Molly: Awh hun. Yeh I bet
03/05/2020, 12:59 - Molly: Get out there. Wave at strangers
03/05/2020, 13:00 - Molly: I always walk Ashton court cuz then there's people nearby but not too close
03/05/2020, 13:00 - Andrew: the trails in the woods are really nice there
03/05/2020, 13:00 - Andrew: some aren't that wide though unfortunately
03/05/2020, 13:02 - Andrew: i have my masks and sanitiseer from deliveroo now so if I feel alright soon I might work
03/05/2020, 13:03 - Molly: Okay just be careful. Remember the mask doesn't protect you much, it protects others
03/05/2020, 13:03 - Andrew: yeah i know
03/05/2020, 13:04 - Andrew: might make the customers feel better
03/05/2020, 13:04 - Molly: Yes but I'm worried about your health
03/05/2020, 13:04 - Molly: You're clearly susceptible to the virus
03/05/2020, 13:05 - Andrew: well maybe i will get a 3rd bout of symptoms at some point
03/05/2020, 13:05 - Andrew: recovery from this seems very complicated and long-winded
03/05/2020, 13:06 - Andrew: if only i didn't work that weekend in march ü§¶‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
03/05/2020, 13:06 - Molly: Have you isolated the full 7 days since the first symptoms?
03/05/2020, 13:07 - Molly: There's nothing more you can do. Life must carry on
03/05/2020, 13:08 - Andrew: i think they started back up again about 2 weeks ago but then got bad enough to rule out bad sleep/bad diet/feeling bad last weekend
03/05/2020, 13:08 - Andrew: haven't left the house since monday morning I think?
03/05/2020, 13:09 - Andrew: at least with flu you know what you're getting üëé
03/05/2020, 13:11 - Molly: Yeh I know, it sucks. Wait another day before working, but you shouldn't be contagious anymore.
Flu is just as dangerous. Tbh pretty similar symptoms
03/05/2020, 13:13 - Andrew: i don't know, severity of symptoms changed hour by hour with this and I felt very high which seemed to come in waves
03/05/2020, 13:13 - Andrew: although general fever/aches/headaches, definitely
03/05/2020, 13:16 - Andrew: but tbh, if i'm going to have this now and if i know it won't cause any lasting damage then I don't mind
03/05/2020, 13:16 - Andrew: happy I have zero commitments :D
03/05/2020, 13:16 - Molly: Probably low oxygen or something. Do you have any lung problems?
03/05/2020, 13:17 - Andrew: none right now
03/05/2020, 13:18 - Andrew: the ring headaches and feeling completely out of it were far bigger problems
03/05/2020, 13:18 - Molly: Should be fine long term
03/05/2020, 13:18 - Molly: That's normal with flu as well
03/05/2020, 13:18 - Andrew: i hope so, niall's lungs are currently quite inflamed right now
03/05/2020, 13:18 - Andrew: i suspect this is covid though
03/05/2020, 13:18 - Molly: Dehydration and fever can do that
03/05/2020, 13:19 - Molly: Yeh for sure
03/05/2020, 13:19 - Andrew: the new trendy virus
03/05/2020, 13:19 - Molly: Very cool
03/05/2020, 13:20 - Andrew: i remember after I had been in bed for several days, compeltely out of it, bad enough for me and luke to call 111 at one point, and later luke told me how thought I just had a bad cold
03/05/2020, 13:21 - Andrew: i think at the time he didn't realise that the 15 confirmed cases in bristol didn't actually mean there's coronavirus in only 15 people in bristol
03/05/2020, 13:22 - Andrew: it did irk me a bad üò¨
03/05/2020, 13:22 - Andrew: a bit*
03/05/2020, 13:22 - Molly: Yeh I think a lot of people thought that. My warehouse got it, but because no one went in for testing, they never closed down
03/05/2020, 13:22 - Molly: Literally everyone got symptoms except me. They never shut
03/05/2020, 13:24 - Andrew: did they not shut until the stricter lockdown started?!
03/05/2020, 13:24 - Molly: Actually they never shut at all. Still open now
03/05/2020, 13:25 - Molly: I'm the only one on furlough
03/05/2020, 13:25 - Andrew: ü§®
03/05/2020, 13:25 - Andrew: well at least you don't have that drive to gloucester for the moment
03/05/2020, 13:26 - Molly: Yeh it's nice. I'm loving all this free time. Plus I've probably had the virus from work, but asymptomatic üòé
03/05/2020, 13:26 - Andrew: odd how some companies act in this pandemic
03/05/2020, 13:26 - Molly: I know. They threatened to fire people if they stayed home
03/05/2020, 13:26 - Andrew: enjoy every second of having no symptoms please if you are asymptomatic
03/05/2020, 13:27 - Molly: Well I just found out I have asthma, so I'm surprised I've survived so well. Who knows ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è I can't wait for the antibody test
03/05/2020, 13:28 - Andrew: maybe the covid didn't reach your brush making corner in the warehouse
03/05/2020, 13:28 - Andrew: by pure chance
03/05/2020, 13:28 - Andrew: or it gets repelled by squirrel hair
03/05/2020, 13:29 - Molly: Maybe, but everyone around me had it. I'm super careful too. You know how OCD I get
03/05/2020, 13:30 - Andrew: i think you've got a good chance of being asymptomatic ü§ô
03/05/2020, 13:31 - Andrew: based on my near zero medical knowledge ü§ô
03/05/2020, 13:31 - Molly: Thanks Dr Andy!!
03/05/2020, 13:32 - Andrew: üë®‚Äç‚öïÔ∏è
03/05/2020, 13:33 - Andrew: "you'll have to give her these, these... and these"
"thank you doctor"
"oh i'm not a doctor"
03/05/2020, 13:33 - Molly: Excuse me?
03/05/2020, 13:33 - Andrew: simpsons quote!
03/05/2020, 13:34 - Molly: Oooh
03/05/2020, 13:34 - Molly: Dr nick?
03/05/2020, 13:34 - Andrew: new covid symptom: forgetting classic simpsons quotes
03/05/2020, 13:34 - Andrew: no it's when lisa drinks the water at the duff brewery theme park
03/05/2020, 13:34 - Andrew: and she says i am the lizard queen
03/05/2020, 13:35 - Molly: Yes clearly I have memory loss
03/05/2020, 13:35 - Andrew: rest up
03/05/2020, 13:35 - Andrew: the quotes will come back to you
03/05/2020, 13:36 - Andrew: as far as I can tell, Lorn has escaped symptoms so far
03/05/2020, 13:37 - Molly: (Media Omitted)
03/05/2020, 13:37 - Andrew: haha
03/05/2020, 13:37 - Molly: Lmao
03/05/2020, 13:40 - Andrew: about to brave the outside world
03/05/2020, 13:40 - Molly: Where you going?
03/05/2020, 13:43 - Andrew: probably to the bridge and back
03/05/2020, 13:43 - Andrew: via the towpath
03/05/2020, 13:43 - Andrew: nothing crazy
03/05/2020, 13:45 - Molly: Sounds wild
03/05/2020, 13:45 - Molly: Enjoy!!
03/05/2020, 14:16 - Andrew: it's dog overload out here
03/05/2020, 14:16 - Molly: Ikr
03/05/2020, 14:16 - Molly: I've had many dog cuddles recently
03/05/2020, 14:30 - Andrew: (Media Omitted)
03/05/2020, 16:28 - Molly: That's so nice. Where is it?
03/05/2020, 16:29 - Andrew: it's up a hill called dead badger's bottom
03/05/2020, 16:29 - Andrew: from the tow path up to the bridge
03/05/2020, 16:30 - Molly: Which tow path? I can't work it out
03/05/2020, 16:32 - Andrew: https://www.google.co.uk/maps/place/51%C2%B027'04.5%22N+2%C2%B037'43.4%22W/@51.4512399,-2.6299767,17z/data=!3m1!4b1!4m6!3m5!1s0x0:0x0!7e2!8m2!3d51.4512376!4d-2.6287238
03/05/2020, 16:32 - Andrew: the path that goes alongside the river out to avonmouth
03/05/2020, 16:40 - Molly: Oh I'll go there next time
03/05/2020, 16:40 - Molly: I need good suggestions
03/05/2020, 16:40 - Molly: I just went festival way for the first time
03/05/2020, 16:41 - Andrew: there's also nightingale valley which is sort of the next path along from badgers
03/05/2020, 16:41 - Andrew: which one is festival way again?
03/05/2020, 16:41 - Andrew: i recognise the name
03/05/2020, 16:42 - Molly: I will look for that
03/05/2020, 16:42 - Molly: That's if you go past Ashton court and keep going. There's a really nice cycle/running path
03/05/2020, 16:45 - Molly: It goes to long Ashton but I haven't done the full walk. I might cycle it tomorrow
03/05/2020, 16:47 - Andrew: oh i know the one!
03/05/2020, 16:48 - Andrew: its nice to cycle on
03/05/2020, 16:48 - Molly: Yeh I bet
03/05/2020, 16:49 - Molly: You've been doing some really long cycles
03/05/2020, 16:49 - Molly: Recommend any?
03/05/2020, 16:49 - Andrew: urm well i tend to take any back road that goes in the direction i want, or a-roads if i just want to take advantage of a mega tailwind
03/05/2020, 16:50 - Andrew: if you turn on the bike paths overlay on google maps, pretty much any of them in or around bristol are decent
03/05/2020, 16:50 - Molly: Okay I'll have a go
03/05/2020, 16:50 - Molly: I'm just scared of cars
03/05/2020, 16:52 - Andrew: loads of pavements have the circular blue shared usage sign in bristol
03/05/2020, 16:52 - Andrew: you can get most places traffic-free
03/05/2020, 16:54 - Andrew: because bikes are better than cars
03/05/2020, 16:54 - Molly: I agree üòä
03/05/2020, 16:54 - Andrew: they're more fun!
03/05/2020, 16:54 - Andrew: and cheaper
03/05/2020, 16:55 - Molly: And, ya know, the environment
03/05/2020, 16:55 - Andrew: like the environment n stuuuff
03/05/2020, 16:55 - Andrew: now everyone knows who clean bristol air can be
03/05/2020, 16:56 - Andrew: how*
03/05/2020, 16:56 - Molly: Something something Greta thunberg something CO2
03/05/2020, 16:56 - Andrew: my brother-in-law and his business partner described her as a "bird brain"
03/05/2020, 16:57 - Andrew: they run businesses and talk about cars and vote tory btw üòí
03/05/2020, 17:01 - Molly: Yes i remember your brother in law üôÉüôÉüôÉ
03/05/2020, 17:01 - Andrew: his business partner is even more stereotypical than that
03/05/2020, 17:03 - Andrew: don't know why i typed that
03/05/2020, 17:03 - Andrew: of course you remember him ü§¶‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
03/05/2020, 17:03 - Andrew: i'm feeling very spaced out now
03/05/2020, 17:05 - Molly: Haha it's okay. Everyone knows someone like that. Theyre the worst
03/05/2020, 17:08 - Andrew: I kind of feel like I've had a pint and a half of beer
03/05/2020, 17:12 - Molly: It's your body burning through energy too fast. Drink more water, eat more protein
03/05/2020, 17:12 - Andrew: i've just eaten a huge amount of protein
03/05/2020, 17:12 - Andrew: for one sitting
03/05/2020, 17:12 - Andrew: might just be post-meal drowsiness
03/05/2020, 17:13 - Molly: Takes 2-3 hours to actually get the energy. Sugar might help in the mean time. Apples and peanut butter!!
03/05/2020, 17:13 - Andrew: i think i need a tea
03/05/2020, 17:13 - Andrew: no apples üëé
03/05/2020, 17:13 - Molly: Sugary tea
03/05/2020, 17:14 - Molly: Oh no!
03/05/2020, 17:14 - Andrew: but just ate 5 satsumas
03/05/2020, 17:14 - Molly: Holt fuk that's too much
03/05/2020, 17:14 - Andrew: they were so good though
03/05/2020, 17:14 - Molly: Doesn't your stomach hurt?
03/05/2020, 17:14 - Andrew: not really
03/05/2020, 17:14 - Andrew: or at all even
03/05/2020, 17:14 - Molly: You're probably craving vitamin c
03/05/2020, 17:15 - Andrew: hmm i do eat a lot of greens
03/05/2020, 17:16 - Andrew: i bought the satsumas becuase they were on offer and i'm a cheapskate at the moment üåù
03/05/2020, 17:17 - Andrew: i'm definitely craving human contact, the most crucial vitamin of all
03/05/2020, 17:17 - Molly: I know, me too üò≠ it's so sad
03/05/2020, 17:17 - Andrew: even a cat letting me hug them would do
03/05/2020, 17:21 - Molly: That'll never happen
03/05/2020, 17:23 - Andrew: yeah you're right
03/05/2020, 17:24 - Andrew: maybe the living room lamp instead
03/05/2020, 17:44 - Molly: Be careful. Electricity and all that
03/05/2020, 18:03 - Andrew: just give me the buzz
03/05/2020, 18:03 - Andrew: anything
03/05/2020, 18:03 - Andrew: to feel
03/05/2020, 18:04 - Molly: Just don't fuk the toaster, ok?
03/05/2020, 18:04 - Andrew: ... fine üòí
03/05/2020, 18:05 - Molly: Good boy
08/05/2020, 21:09 - Molly: Hey. You good?
08/05/2020, 21:09 - Andrew: yeah im at a party tonight :)
08/05/2020, 21:09 - Molly: What?! A social event?!
08/05/2020, 21:09 - Andrew: (Media Omitted)
08/05/2020, 21:10 - Andrew: my friend alan is on the decks, streaming on twitch, the music is streaming on mixlr and zoom for everyone's webcams
08/05/2020, 21:10 - Molly: Why do you all look so miserable
08/05/2020, 21:10 - Andrew: we aren't, we're all bopping to the rhythm
08/05/2020, 21:11 - Molly: Ah I see. It's a kinda üòé look
08/05/2020, 21:12 - Andrew: its really fun! im chain drinking the teas
08/05/2020, 21:13 - Andrew: havent seen some of these people for a year or two now
08/05/2020, 21:13 - Andrew: hows your evening?
08/05/2020, 21:16 - Molly: That sounds so chill!
08/05/2020, 21:16 - Molly: Yeh it's okay. Had a little stroll earlier, and then dinner with my housemates
08/05/2020, 21:17 - Andrew: nice
08/05/2020, 21:17 - Andrew: feels like lockdown is over tbh
08/05/2020, 21:17 - Andrew: lorn has spent the day with one of our neighbours
08/05/2020, 21:18 - Molly: Yeh but it's a scary thing. Everyone is out together in the street like there's no virus. I bet this will cause a massive second wave
08/05/2020, 21:18 - Molly: Sorry I'm being a downer. It was nice to see people out tho
08/05/2020, 21:19 - Andrew: yeah everything sucks :(
08/05/2020, 21:19 - Molly: I don't want to go back to work too soon. I know this sucks, but we won't even remember this bit
08/05/2020, 21:20 - Andrew: we've got the ginormous economic downturn to look forward toüéä
08/05/2020, 21:20 - Andrew: i want to start deliverooing again asap
08/05/2020, 21:21 - Molly: I'm wanna buy a house
08/05/2020, 21:21 - Molly: Why can't you deliveroo
08/05/2020, 21:24 - Andrew: still recovering
08/05/2020, 21:24 - Molly: Still??? Are you feeling okay?
08/05/2020, 21:25 - Andrew: well the symptoms have gone but i just have a persistent headache and fatigue which is very very slowly disappearing
08/05/2020, 21:25 - Andrew: which my doctor said is most likely post-viral fatigue and it will take a while
08/05/2020, 21:25 - Molly: Wow it really got you bad then. Are you getting enough vitamin c and D?
08/05/2020, 21:25 - Andrew: plenty!

14/05/2020, 18:57 - Molly: FFS I'll see if I can run tomorrow instead

14/05/2020, 21:05 - Molly: What you're not joking? He's actually in a tree house?
14/05/2020, 21:05 - Andrew: so i'm sure he's just staying with her in her house like any normal person would
14/05/2020, 21:05 - Molly: Yeh ofc. He's such a weird guy
14/05/2020, 21:06 - Andrew: he definitely does his own thing ü§∑üèΩ‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è

14/05/2020, 23:01 - Molly: If it weren't Bach ofc
16/05/2020, 08:02 - Andrew: I think tomorrow would work best for me to meet up
16/05/2020, 08:04 - Molly: That works for me. Weather looks crummy today anyway
16/05/2020, 09:50 - Andrew: excellent ü§ôüèº
16/05/2020, 19:47 - Molly: Are you watching Eurovision

16/05/2020, 20:49 - Molly: No one wins this year
16/05/2020, 20:50 - Andrew: so that means the virus is hosting next year then
16/05/2020, 21:05 - Molly: Yeh should be a wild one

17/05/2020, 09:41 - Andrew: the one where the skaters go
17/05/2020, 09:48 - Molly: You can't really sit anywhere in there. Greville park maybe easier

28/05/2020, 20:13 - Andrew: just nostalgia really
28/05/2020, 20:13 - Andrew: we all liked it when we were kiddies
28/05/2020, 20:13 - Molly: My dad used to watch them. They're so boring
28/05/2020, 20:14 - Andrew: i like more the gossip and drama
28/05/2020, 20:14 - Andrew: and drivers slagging other ones off
28/05/2020, 20:14 - Molly: Cars gossip?
28/05/2020, 20:14 - Andrew: paddock gossip üíÖ
28/05/2020, 20:15 - Molly: Mate, I hear he's got a tiny engine
28/05/2020, 20:15 - Andrew: a phrase often used when a team brings in a new aero update for a race is "a new package"
28/05/2020, 20:15 - Andrew: üåùnice package m8
28/05/2020, 20:16 - Molly: Fuk that would've been good
28/05/2020, 20:16 - Molly: Nice package but runs outta fuel in 30 seconds
28/05/2020, 21:23 - Andrew: woah he's got a really tight front-end
28/05/2020, 21:38 - Molly: ...what
28/05/2020, 21:39 - Andrew: front-end like the front wheels and front wing
28/05/2020, 21:39 - Andrew: just f1 stuff
28/05/2020, 21:59 - Molly: But what's the tight front end on a person?!
28/05/2020, 22:00 - Andrew: üåù
28/05/2020, 22:00 - Andrew: iunno
28/05/2020, 22:00 - Molly: No
28/05/2020, 22:00 - Molly: That doesn't work
28/05/2020, 22:00 - Andrew: like a new package
28/05/2020, 22:01 - Molly: No no no don't compare it. Package is clear. Tight front end is nothing
28/05/2020, 22:03 - Andrew: another thing that commentators say when someone overtakes someone on the inside of a corner is "he came up the inside of him"
28/05/2020, 22:03 - Andrew: like damon hill just came up the inside of schumacher
28/05/2020, 22:06 - Molly: Hmm okay I'll let you have that one, but leave Schumacher out of this
28/05/2020, 22:07 - Andrew: he had his fair share of dirty racing back in the day
28/05/2020, 22:08 - Andrew: very controversial
28/05/2020, 22:10 - Molly: When does the stig race?

11/06/2020, 17:55 - Andrew: i suspect it will be fine though, just want at least some reassurance
11/06/2020, 17:57 - Molly: To check for antibodies?
11/06/2020, 18:03 - Andrew: no just b12, vit d, thyroid and other things
11/06/2020, 18:03 - Andrew: niall tested negative for antibodies and his doc thinks he had it so the tests could be a bit shit still
11/06/2020, 18:04 - Molly: Oh yeh I've had that test. They're usually looking for anemia, or some other easy thing
11/06/2020, 18:05 - Molly: Yes the false positive is nearly 50%
11/06/2020, 18:05 - Andrew: yeah i was hoping for the antibody test mainly :p
11/06/2020, 18:05 - Andrew: but now i know theres no point anyway
11/06/2020, 18:05 - Molly: The antibody blood test way more effective than the swab. But they can't be blood testing everyone
11/06/2020, 18:06 - Molly: They're only blood testing doctors ect
11/06/2020, 18:06 - Molly: The swab is basically a waste of time
11/06/2020, 18:08 - Andrew: as if everything wasn't bad enough alreadyüôÉ
11/06/2020, 18:09 - Andrew: but remember we get to have social bubbles now
11/06/2020, 18:35 - Molly: Bubble?
11/06/2020, 18:36 - Andrew: well actually i think it's more for people in single households
11/06/2020, 18:36 - Andrew: they can go to the homes of other people and even stay the night
11/06/2020, 18:36 - Andrew: without social distancing

11/06/2020, 18:40 - Andrew: actually lorn came back today so now i'm just single and annoyed
11/06/2020, 18:40 - Molly: At least you're not lonely
11/06/2020, 18:40 - Molly: And you were single before the virus too
11/06/2020, 18:40 - Andrew: i know
11/06/2020, 18:40 - Andrew: it's the virus' fault
11/06/2020, 18:41 - Andrew: if my kevin didn't live so far away I would social bubble with him
11/06/2020, 18:43 - Molly: Cats don't carry the virus ffs
11/06/2020, 18:44 - Andrew: i know they don't!
11/06/2020, 18:45 - Molly: You can have many cats, but you can't force them to bubble with you
11/06/2020, 18:45 - Andrew: i'm sure kevin would test positive for missing me ‚ù§Ô∏è
11/06/2020, 18:47 - Molly: Jesus Christ

11/06/2020, 18:51 - Andrew: i think it's just any two households as long as one of the households it's just a single person
11/06/2020, 18:52 - Andrew: is just*
11/06/2020, 18:52 - Molly: I count as single cuz I fukin stay away from my housemates

11/06/2020, 18:54 - Molly: Exactly
11/06/2020, 18:54 - Molly: Is it two households at a time? Or you pick one, and that's it for a while?
11/06/2020, 18:54 - Andrew: yeah i think you have to choose just one household to do it with
11/06/2020, 18:55 - Molly: Wow that's a big decision
11/06/2020, 18:55 - Molly: How do you get your whole house to agree?
11/06/2020, 18:56 - Andrew: that's part of the fun

15/06/2020, 21:44 - Molly: You're one of the only people with short hair rn. Can't complain
15/06/2020, 21:45 - Andrew: i know, i'm feeling good and ready to socialise in large groups
15/06/2020, 21:46 - Andrew: oh wait
15/06/2020, 21:46 - Molly: Aha nice try!
15/06/2020, 21:46 - Andrew: at least i found out that i like animal crossing
15/06/2020, 21:46 - Molly: Stick to your bubble!
15/06/2020, 21:46 - Molly: Dammit I want ac. But I ain't got a ds
15/06/2020, 21:46 - Andrew: it is the cutest game ever made
15/06/2020, 21:47 - Molly: I know
15/06/2020, 21:47 - Molly: I used the play the old one
15/06/2020, 21:47 - Andrew: dana's island is really nice and all her islanders are lovely
15/06/2020, 21:47 - Andrew: ah
15/06/2020, 21:51 - Andrew: last night i accidentally scared a ghost and his soul scattered all over the island
15/06/2020, 21:52 - Andrew: i had to find all the pieces and when i returned them he gave me some nice 3/4 lengths
15/06/2020, 22:07 - Molly: Why are you taunting me?! I don't have a console!
15/06/2020, 22:12 - Andrew: welli wish i had one too :(
15/06/2020, 22:12 - Molly: What are you playing on?
15/06/2020, 22:12 - Andrew: i was playing on danas new switch
15/06/2020, 22:12 - Molly: Ah that makes sense
15/06/2020, 22:13 - Andrew: she cooked and then cut my hair and then i played on her animal crossing game for ages
15/06/2020, 22:13 - Andrew: niall done good
15/06/2020, 22:13 - Molly: She's such a sweetie
15/06/2020, 22:14 - Andrew: she really is!
15/06/2020, 22:14 - Andrew: she teaches niall latvian everyday too
15/06/2020, 22:15 - Andrew: did you see marilou on the weekend?
15/06/2020, 22:35 - Molly: I did ü•∞. I'll tell you all about it tomorrow. Gotta catch some zzzs. Got another house viewing tomorrow after work
16/06/2020, 20:20 - Molly: Heyo.
So yeah I joined marilou's household bubble. Got to go inside and eat homemade snacks. Was the highlight of the year. Didn't realize how much isolation was getting to me
16/06/2020, 20:20 - Molly: What I got to do to get Dana to cut my hair?
16/06/2020, 20:22 - Andrew: hah well i think she only cuts hair short
16/06/2020, 20:22 - Andrew: but why wouldnt you want me amazing hairstyle
16/06/2020, 20:22 - Andrew: my*
16/06/2020, 20:23 - Molly: Shave my head. I'm done with this fukin hair
16/06/2020, 20:23 - Andrew: üò¶
16/06/2020, 20:23 - Molly: You don't think it'll suit me?
16/06/2020, 20:24 - Andrew: i dont know honestly, i generally prefer the exact opposite length of hair
16/06/2020, 20:24 - Andrew: maybe im just enforcing gender stereotypes and im totally wrong
16/06/2020, 20:26 - Andrew: headache has been a bit crap today üëéüèº
16/06/2020, 20:26 - Molly: It's fine to be honest. And it's great that you acknowledged it.
16/06/2020, 20:26 - Molly: Oh no. Are you drinking enough water
16/06/2020, 20:28 - Andrew: plenty, pissing like a racehorse these days
16/06/2020, 20:29 - Andrew: long hair is more of an aesthetic preference though
16/06/2020, 20:29 - Molly: Gross üòé
16/06/2020, 20:29 - Molly: On a girl?
16/06/2020, 20:30 - Andrew: yeah i just prefer how it looks
16/06/2020, 20:30 - Andrew: personally
16/06/2020, 20:30 - Andrew: in my opinion
16/06/2020, 20:30 - Andrew: please don't cancel me
16/06/2020, 20:30 - Molly: I think most feel that way
16/06/2020, 20:30 - Molly: It's hard to pull off really short hair unless you have amazing bone structure
16/06/2020, 20:31 - Andrew: i prefer bones in a girl
16/06/2020, 20:31 - Andrew: just personal preference really
16/06/2020, 20:31 - Molly: I like my hair just above shoulder length cuz I have a heart shaped face. You would need a hard jawline for a pixie cut
16/06/2020, 20:31 - Molly: I'm choosing to ignore your stupid comments
16/06/2020, 20:33 - Andrew: ok just as long as they're made of atoms then that's good
16/06/2020, 20:35 - Andrew: i don't know what cut would look best on me, just boring and short is fine for me
16/06/2020, 20:36 - Andrew: btw i deleted my tinder a while ago, recently made a new one, saw you on it and you had written someone was using your photos?!
16/06/2020, 20:37 - Molly: Mullet. Don't be a coward
16/06/2020, 20:38 - Molly: Oh yeh it got real weird. So many fake profiles trying to convince me to trust them, whilst also having fake profiles of me. I can't tell who's behind them but it's someone who knows me/lives near me. Got kinda scary at one point
16/06/2020, 20:39 - Molly: You better have fukin swiped right, you little shit
16/06/2020, 20:39 - Andrew: the fuuuck
16/06/2020, 20:39 - Andrew: i actually can't remember
16/06/2020, 20:39 - Molly: If you see the fake profile, can you screenshot it for me?
16/06/2020, 20:39 - Andrew: possibly left
16/06/2020, 20:39 - Andrew: yeah sure
16/06/2020, 20:39 - Andrew: is that why you asked for proof if I was real when we were talking on tinder at first?
16/06/2020, 20:40 - Andrew: or was this afterwards
16/06/2020, 20:41 - Molly: This was really recently. But someone contacted me on Facebook to let me know about the fake profile. I haven't used tindr in so long
16/06/2020, 20:41 - Molly: You're dead to me
16/06/2020, 20:44 - Andrew: i had already used my super like and you deserve only the best
16/06/2020, 20:44 - Andrew: not a plain boring regular like
16/06/2020, 20:45 - Andrew: that fake account stuff is horrible, that would keep me awake at night
16/06/2020, 20:45 - Andrew: not that anyone ever would use my photos
16/06/2020, 20:46 - Molly: Nice save
16/06/2020, 20:47 - Molly: Yeh it super weirded me out. The girl who told me, I thought she was super nice, until I realised she was a fake profile too. All the profiles are in Swindon for some reason
16/06/2020, 20:47 - Andrew: !!!!
16/06/2020, 20:47 - Andrew: even creepier
16/06/2020, 20:47 - Molly: The pictures on the fake profile of me were screenshots of my real FB page, with my actual full name
16/06/2020, 20:48 - Molly: So they definitely knew me and lived near me
16/06/2020, 20:48 - Molly: But they just wanted to talk and stuff. So I think it's someone who has a thing for me, that maybe I rejected
16/06/2020, 20:49 - Andrew: what did you talk about with them?
16/06/2020, 20:50 - Andrew: this is some black mirror shit
16/06/2020, 20:52 - Molly: Work and stuff. She sent pics. Told me I was pretty (she's apparently gay too. Covering all their bases) wanted to meet eventually. Gave me phone number of the "friend that got catfished by the fake profile." But apparently he's not on socials. Very confusing
16/06/2020, 20:52 - Andrew: i take it you didn't ring it
16/06/2020, 20:53 - Andrew: or pursue it any further
16/06/2020, 20:56 - Andrew: if it's any consolation your tinder photos were good ones when i saw the other day
16/06/2020, 21:05 - Molly: Thanks aha clearly someone liked them
16/06/2020, 22:24 - Andrew: lorn's eating in the kitchen
16/06/2020, 22:24 - Andrew: turning my music up
16/06/2020, 22:24 - Andrew: i just can't hack it
17/06/2020, 11:43 - Molly: Cronch cronch cronch
17/06/2020, 15:52 - Andrew: how was the house viewing?
17/06/2020, 15:57 - Molly: Meh. Least favourite so far. It was next to queen Square, but it was like so tiny and at the top floor of a Victorian building
17/06/2020, 15:57 - Molly: I got my eye on one in filton currently
17/06/2020, 15:58 - Andrew: ooh closer to work
17/06/2020, 15:59 - Andrew: queen square flats probably cost an üí™üèº and a ü¶µüèº
17/06/2020, 16:02 - Molly: It was really cheap. But I can totally see why.
The filton one is further from town, but if I got good at cycling, it's only 10 mins to Gloucester road
17/06/2020, 16:03 - Molly: Also the flat is Hella nice with big doors that open into a garden
17/06/2020, 16:04 - Andrew: how much wonga we talkin'? üí¥
17/06/2020, 16:04 - Andrew: not that i know how much a house costs anyway
17/06/2020, 16:07 - Molly: That one was 149k. That's cheap.
The filton one is 175k. That's kinda my limit and it's only one room, ground floor
17/06/2020, 16:07 - Andrew: good lawd that is cheap
17/06/2020, 16:08 - Andrew: i'll probably be buying a house in 20 years
17/06/2020, 16:08 - Molly: It's hard to get a mortgage alone. My bro is buying a flat with his girlfriend for 500k
17/06/2020, 16:09 - Molly: Yeh I dunno how anyone our age buys a flat. You have to have at least 25% in cash
17/06/2020, 16:09 - Andrew: my old housemate bought a semi-detached in brislington for roughly 200k, was mega expensive for what it was
17/06/2020, 16:09 - Andrew: oh :(
17/06/2020, 16:09 - Andrew: 30 years then
17/06/2020, 16:09 - Molly: Get a rich girlfriend
17/06/2020, 16:10 - Molly: If I had a partner, regardless of our actual money, the mortgage would be doubled. Big ol' house
17/06/2020, 16:10 - Molly: They wouldn't even need any money
17/06/2020, 16:11 - Andrew: it doubles if two people start living there?!
17/06/2020, 16:11 - Andrew: why not just lie
17/06/2020, 16:12 - Andrew: surely that's not illegal üåù
17/06/2020, 16:13 - Molly: Yeh as long as you're working. It's 4.5 X your income.
So if you and I teamed up, with the deposit I have now, we could get a house for 350k. BUT you split it legally. It's so hard to separate it. You both sign so many forms
17/06/2020, 16:15 - Molly: But we'd only pay about ¬£350 a month off the mortgage. Cheaper than rent ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è
17/06/2020, 16:15 - Andrew: teamwork :P
17/06/2020, 16:15 - Molly: Exactly
17/06/2020, 16:15 - Andrew: yeah that's a lot a cheaper
17/06/2020, 16:15 - Molly: Aha. Very dangerous team work. It would be so easy to steal someone's money that way
17/06/2020, 16:16 - Andrew: and i would be able to install as many bike racks as i wanted
17/06/2020, 16:16 - Andrew: and a living room bike workshop
17/06/2020, 16:16 - Molly: ......
17/06/2020, 16:16 - Andrew: no problems whatsoever
17/06/2020, 16:17 - Andrew: your easel can go in the corner
17/06/2020, 16:18 - Molly: (Media Omitted)
17/06/2020, 16:18 - Molly: I'm out
17/06/2020, 16:18 - Andrew: woo free house!
17/06/2020, 16:18 - Molly: Ugh jealous
17/06/2020, 16:19 - Molly: I'm coming over
17/06/2020, 16:19 - Andrew: no i meant because you left our house
17/06/2020, 16:19 - Molly: No I kicked you out
17/06/2020, 16:19 - Andrew: i do actually have a free house though, lorn is somewhere in bristol ü§î
17/06/2020, 16:20 - Molly: ... somewhere?
17/06/2020, 16:20 - Andrew: no idea where he does, usually his girlfriends'
17/06/2020, 16:20 - Andrew: goes*
17/06/2020, 16:20 - Molly: He fully breaks the rules. You should too
17/06/2020, 16:21 - Molly: Party?
17/06/2020, 16:21 - Andrew: luke and lorn were breaking the rules before me anyway ü§∑üèº‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
17/06/2020, 16:21 - Molly: Do it
17/06/2020, 16:22 - Andrew: my head can't hack a party ü§ï
17/06/2020, 16:22 - Molly: You working evenings?
17/06/2020, 16:23 - Andrew: i'm not working at all these days, and probably not for another week or two
17/06/2020, 16:24 - Molly: You wanna do dinner one evening? We could sit outside, or park, order take out?
17/06/2020, 16:24 - Molly: If you're feeling up to it
17/06/2020, 16:24 - Andrew: yeah that sounds great
17/06/2020, 16:25 - Molly: Perfect. I promise I'll shower
17/06/2020, 16:25 - Andrew: friday i'm seeing joe niall and dana
17/06/2020, 16:25 - Andrew: aw :')
17/06/2020, 16:25 - Molly: When are you free?

17/06/2020, 16:25 - Andrew: saturday?
17/06/2020, 16:26 - Andrew: it's pretty likely lorn will be out on the saturday, i'll ask him when I next see him
17/06/2020, 16:26 - Molly: Saturday should work for me
17/06/2020, 16:26 - Andrew: ü§ô
17/06/2020, 16:26 - Molly: Let me know
17/06/2020, 16:27 - Andrew: i will, we could get a mcdonalds like old times
17/06/2020, 16:28 - Molly: Ugh yes! My first maccys
17/06/2020, 16:28 - Andrew: i don't think they offer milkshakes though
17/06/2020, 16:28 - Molly: WHAT
17/06/2020, 16:28 - Andrew: yeah exactly what's the fuckin point
17/06/2020, 16:29 - Molly: Do they actually not?
17/06/2020, 16:29 - Andrew: just checked on ubereats, they don't
17/06/2020, 16:29 - Andrew: üòíüéâ
17/06/2020, 16:30 - Molly: Even on drive thru?
17/06/2020, 16:30 - Andrew: do you want to queue for an hour?
17/06/2020, 16:31 - Molly: I've heard it's quick. But I see your point
17/06/2020, 16:31 - Molly: Or wagas is open now. Just sayin

17/06/2020, 16:33 - Molly: Lmao
17/06/2020, 16:33 - Andrew: that's actually a gif where i do the same reaction as the gif when I see the gif itself
17/06/2020, 16:34 - Molly: I did the same for my disgusted gif
17/06/2020, 16:34 - Andrew: ok you can set your easel up in the cupboard under the stairs
17/06/2020, 16:35 - Andrew: it's cosy
17/06/2020, 16:35 - Molly: Get out my house
17/06/2020, 16:36 - Andrew: don't know why but that reminded me of:
17/06/2020, 16:37 - Andrew: (Media Omitted)
17/06/2020, 16:37 - Molly: Where is that from?!
17/06/2020, 16:37 - Molly: I love it
17/06/2020, 16:37 - Andrew: there's a whole series of them, i'll try and find them
17/06/2020, 16:38 - Molly: OK I need to leave work now
17/06/2020, 16:38 - Andrew: yeah you were working hard just then

17/06/2020, 18:55 - Andrew: and i last had symptoms 6 weeks ago so you needn't worry :P
17/06/2020, 18:56 - Andrew: come to think of it the closest human contact i've had for months is dana pulling my ear back to shave around it
17/06/2020, 19:04 - Molly: Oh super ew

17/06/2020, 19:05 - Andrew: üò¶
17/06/2020, 19:06 - Andrew: you know i really could've done without 2 weeks of symptoms and 5 weeks of post-viral fatigue
17/06/2020, 19:06 - Andrew: i thought i would've been fine
17/06/2020, 19:08 - Molly: I know but we're all gonna get it eventually. Plus I'm in the best category. I might not even feel it
17/06/2020, 19:08 - Molly: You got it so bad cuz you're a bot
17/06/2020, 19:08 - Molly: Boy
17/06/2020, 19:08 - Molly: How did Dana handle it?
17/06/2020, 19:09 - Andrew: i think she felt very mild flu symptoms on and off for about a week or two
17/06/2020, 19:09 - Andrew: barely even that
17/06/2020, 20:00 - Molly: Yeh that's how girls get it
17/06/2020, 20:00 - Molly: I mean, I'd rather a vaccine. But failing that, I can handle flu
17/06/2020, 20:03 - Andrew: (Media Omitted)
17/06/2020, 20:03 - Andrew: cat chat now

17/06/2020, 21:48 - Molly: Cute ü•∞

18/06/2020, 18:06 - Andrew: this is the longest march of my life
18/06/2020, 18:07 - Molly: Maprilune
18/06/2020, 18:07 - Molly: This is the longest week of my life
18/06/2020, 18:07 - Andrew: well you're off work now aren't you?
18/06/2020, 18:15 - Molly: No I work Fridays now üòü
18/06/2020, 18:15 - Molly: (Media Omitted)
18/06/2020, 18:16 - Molly: My colleagues tryna drag me through the week
18/06/2020, 18:30 - Andrew: oooooh that sucks
18/06/2020, 18:30 - Andrew: 5 day working week in gloucester
18/06/2020, 18:30 - Andrew: üëé
18/06/2020, 21:30 - Molly: (Media Omitted)
18/06/2020, 21:33 - Andrew: metal as fuck
18/06/2020, 21:33 - Andrew: those blocks of flats are close to your place as well
18/06/2020, 21:34 - Molly: I know. I think I know which strike this was. I had just pulled up and it struck right over me. I jumped out the car so fukin fast! Being in a car is so dangerous if you get hit
18/06/2020, 21:35 - Andrew: well I asked lorn where he was during the storm
18/06/2020, 21:35 - Andrew: he was in a treehouse
18/06/2020, 21:35 - Andrew: safe
18/06/2020, 21:35 - Molly: That's fukin stupid
18/06/2020, 21:35 - Andrew: haha
18/06/2020, 21:35 - Andrew: well yeah
18/06/2020, 21:36 - Molly: I mean, we're in a city, so should hit a tower block instead. But you wouldn't want to be caught in the wave
18/06/2020, 21:36 - Andrew: well i think thunderstorms are fun :P
18/06/2020, 21:36 - Andrew: worth the very very small chance of dieing
18/06/2020, 21:38 - Andrew: just found out i've been misspelling dying my whole life
18/06/2020, 21:42 - Molly: Ahaha youre so fukin dumb
18/06/2020, 21:42 - Andrew: üòí
18/06/2020, 21:42 - Molly: Why would you assume two i
18/06/2020, 21:43 - Andrew: just found out dieing is actually a word
18/06/2020, 21:44 - Andrew: I was actually referring to a machine called a die-cut machine that cuts out shapes, letters, and numbers from paper
18/06/2020, 21:44 - Andrew: i avoid dieing usually but the chance of doing it goes up in thunderstorms
18/06/2020, 21:45 - Molly: This is so dumb. I love it
18/06/2020, 21:45 - Andrew: ok i'm wrong get off my case
18/06/2020, 21:45 - Molly: Words are fun
18/06/2020, 21:45 - Molly: No no you deserve it
18/06/2020, 21:46 - Andrew: also an archaic use of the word die means "to have an orgasm"
18/06/2020, 21:46 - Andrew: someone fucking kill me now
18/06/2020, 21:47 - Molly: Probably from the french
18/06/2020, 21:47 - Molly: Le petit morte. A little death
18/06/2020, 21:47 - Andrew: possibly, i haven't got to that duolingo lesson yet
18/06/2020, 21:48 - Molly: It's so much poetic in French. But morte, die, alone doesn't mean orgasm. You're good
18/06/2020, 21:51 - Andrew: so, ma bite √° mort√© doesn't mean orgasm
18/06/2020, 21:52 - Molly: Um
18/06/2020, 21:52 - Molly: Wtf
18/06/2020, 21:52 - Molly: My dick is dead???
18/06/2020, 21:52 - Andrew: i'll just use the more boring "orgasme"
18/06/2020, 21:52 - Andrew: üëé
18/06/2020, 21:53 - Molly: Um babe?
18/06/2020, 21:53 - Andrew: un nouveua mot pour mon cerveau
18/06/2020, 21:53 - Molly: (Media Omitted)
18/06/2020, 21:53 - Molly: Whoa!
18/06/2020, 21:53 - Andrew: i know it means that :P
18/06/2020, 21:54 - Molly: Where are you learning these phrases
18/06/2020, 21:54 - Andrew: well I said un nouveau mot pour mon cerveau to myself and it rhymes so I'm going to say it if a french person teaches me a word in the future
18/06/2020, 21:56 - Molly: It's very cute
18/06/2020, 21:56 - Molly: And makes you look smart. I didn't know cerveau
18/06/2020, 21:56 - Andrew: my accent is currently terrible when i say it though
18/06/2020, 21:57 - Molly: To get into the accent I say 'reddit' in a French accent till it sounds right
18/06/2020, 21:58 - Molly: It should be like 'ready' but Rs in French are with your tongue
18/06/2020, 21:59 - Andrew: i think with individual words i can do a decent accent
18/06/2020, 21:59 - Andrew: when it all slurs together my mouth just can't hack it
18/06/2020, 21:59 - Molly: That's a good start
18/06/2020, 22:00 - Andrew: I barely enunciate even in english
18/06/2020, 22:00 - Molly: Your lisp gives you a leg up tho
18/06/2020, 22:01 - Molly: Just over exaggerate everything
18/06/2020, 22:02 - Andrew: i'm sure it will come with time
18/06/2020, 22:03 - Andrew: i've only just started bothering to put the accents in all the words :D
18/06/2020, 22:03 - Andrew: i don't have that much of a lisp do I?
18/06/2020, 22:03 - Molly: (Media Omitted)
18/06/2020, 22:04 - Andrew: mmmmbaguette oui oui
18/06/2020, 22:04 - Molly: It sounds stupid to us, but better to a native French speaker. Pick and choose when you do it
18/06/2020, 22:04 - Molly: Same lisp as me. Only I would notice it
18/06/2020, 22:05 - Andrew: yeah we do actually have similar sounding lisps
18/06/2020, 22:05 - Andrew: lithp buddieth
18/06/2020, 22:06 - Molly: Wow. How dare you mock me
18/06/2020, 22:06 - Molly: Tho rude
18/06/2020, 22:07 - Andrew: oh pleath
18/06/2020, 22:08 - Andrew: why do i have a leg up with lisp btw?
18/06/2020, 22:10 - Molly: Lotta spitting and phleming in French. You gotta imagine your tongue is too big for your mouth
18/06/2020, 22:10 - Molly: In our cases, it is
18/06/2020, 22:11 - Andrew: yeah I think i'm still at the stage of sounding like a brit speaking french
18/06/2020, 22:12 - Molly: It's just confidence
18/06/2020, 22:13 - Andrew: i forgot the word for aeroplanes and all I could say was "les oiseaux machines"
18/06/2020, 22:15 - Andrew: i'm sure a french person would get what I meant, unless they thought of machines that produce birds ü§î
18/06/2020, 22:15 - Molly: Nah they'd understand. That's actually kinda funny
18/06/2020, 22:16 - Molly: Also
18/06/2020, 22:16 - Molly: You forgot the word for aeroplane?
18/06/2020, 22:16 - Andrew: well i know it now forever
18/06/2020, 22:16 - Andrew: i'm learning!
18/06/2020, 22:17 - Andrew: je veux m'ameliorer
18/06/2020, 22:18 - Molly: You can actually say a√©roplane
18/06/2020, 22:19 - Andrew: i would probably say avion in future
18/06/2020, 22:19 - Andrew: unless they're not totally equivalent
18/06/2020, 22:19 - Molly: Very cute. Again, I didn't know that. Had to Google it
18/06/2020, 22:20 - Molly: They're not exactly the same but they totally acceptable
18/06/2020, 22:20 - Molly: Like someone saying jet, I guess. You know what they mean
18/06/2020, 22:20 - Andrew: i know not to guess the french version of preservative however
18/06/2020, 22:21 - Andrew: le truc metal dans le ciel
18/06/2020, 22:21 - Andrew: maybe i wouldn't say that if I did website work for an aviation company
18/06/2020, 22:22 - Molly: That's not a better option!
18/06/2020, 22:22 - Molly: If you don't know the word, say the English in a French way. Same origin anyway
18/06/2020, 22:22 - Andrew: yes but not for preservative
18/06/2020, 22:23 - Andrew: or I think "visit"
18/06/2020, 22:23 - Andrew: pr√©servatif means condom
18/06/2020, 22:24 - Andrew: also if you use visit to mean visit a friend a french person would think that you went and opened the door to your friend and inspected inside of them, like a building
18/06/2020, 22:24 - Molly: Oh right yes but it's not quite the same. More like protection, or preservation. Rather than preservative like jam
18/06/2020, 22:25 - Molly: Yeh you'd say regarde probably
18/06/2020, 22:25 - Andrew: i watch my friends
18/06/2020, 22:25 - Molly: Holy shit my phone will not let me type English anymore
18/06/2020, 22:25 - Andrew: üåù
18/06/2020, 22:25 - Molly: I saw my friends
18/06/2020, 22:25 - Molly: I think
18/06/2020, 22:25 - Molly: Ffs I'll check
18/06/2020, 22:26 - Andrew: or voire
18/06/2020, 22:26 - Andrew: actually that often means to view
18/06/2020, 22:26 - Andrew: view my friends from a distance üî≠
18/06/2020, 22:26 - Molly: No voire works
18/06/2020, 22:26 - Molly: Visite does work too
18/06/2020, 22:28 - Andrew: so it does
18/06/2020, 22:28 - Andrew: but apparently with rendre in front of it
18/06/2020, 22:29 - Andrew: ma tete contient plus mots maintenant üëç
18/06/2020, 22:30 - Molly: J'ai mal √† la t√™te maintenant
18/06/2020, 22:31 - Andrew: pas bon
18/06/2020, 22:31 - Molly: Non
18/06/2020, 22:31 - Molly: Trop fran√ßais
18/06/2020, 22:32 - Molly: Trop de Fran√ßais
18/06/2020, 22:32 - Andrew: n'arretez pas le francais
18/06/2020, 22:32 - Molly: Ffs
18/06/2020, 22:33 - Molly: Ma grammaire, c'est nul
18/06/2020, 22:33 - Molly: Mon?
18/06/2020, 22:33 - Andrew: urm no clue
18/06/2020, 22:34 - Andrew: the gender stuff doesn't make sense to me
18/06/2020, 22:34 - Andrew: violon is masc, but voiture is fem
18/06/2020, 22:35 - Andrew: (Media Omitted)
18/06/2020, 22:36 - Molly: Yeh it's cuz we're the only language without genders. So it's so hard for us to learn all of them from scratch
18/06/2020, 22:37 - Andrew: je comprendra finalement
18/06/2020, 22:38 - Andrew: or eventually
18/06/2020, 22:38 - Andrew: or whatever
18/06/2020, 22:38 - Molly: I always get them wrong but some stick. Assume most nouns are masc
18/06/2020, 22:39 - Molly: But some things feel feminine. Like language, or a chair
18/06/2020, 22:40 - Andrew: yeah "ce chaise" looks wrong to me now, but "cette chaise" looks right
18/06/2020, 22:40 - Molly: They both look fukin weird
18/06/2020, 22:40 - Andrew: haha
18/06/2020, 22:40 - Andrew: well yeah french is weird of course
18/06/2020, 22:41 - Andrew: cheese eating surrender monkeys
18/06/2020, 22:41 - Molly: Even the french know it's dumb
18/06/2020, 22:41 - Andrew: ils sont stupides
18/06/2020, 22:42 - Molly: Ta m√®re es un hamster
18/06/2020, 22:42 - Molly: Une hamster ?
18/06/2020, 22:42 - Molly: Un jambon-ster
18/06/2020, 22:42 - Andrew: et ton pere sentit de ... fruits
18/06/2020, 22:43 - Molly: It's elderberries, right? Go with Cassis
18/06/2020, 22:43 - Andrew: sureau!
18/06/2020, 22:43 - Andrew: le mot est sureau
18/06/2020, 22:43 - Molly: Your French is getting really good btw
18/06/2020, 22:44 - Molly: I did not know that. I went with liquor
18/06/2020, 22:44 - Andrew: well give me about 30 seconds to think of responses and they usually make sense
18/06/2020, 22:45 - Molly: 30 seconds is not long
18/06/2020, 22:45 - Molly: That's really good
18/06/2020, 22:45 - Andrew: ma traduction de ma tete est trop lente pour mon discours
18/06/2020, 22:45 - Molly: We'll practice together
18/06/2020, 22:48 - Molly: Just be like oooo eeeer mais Oui
18/06/2020, 22:48 - Andrew: excellente, nous pouvons apprendre
18/06/2020, 22:48 - Andrew: oooooeee sacre blue hohh hohhh hoohhhhh oh la la

21/06/2020, 13:54 - Molly: You'd have to give the artist I think. Or it would be too hard
21/06/2020, 13:54 - Andrew: or do it for a really well known song
21/06/2020, 13:54 - Andrew: i'm also thinking how I could download the group whatsapp chat and determine which words have been said the most

21/06/2020, 14:00 - Molly: There's a web page where you can paste in a script and it calculates the most used words. But I dunno how you'd make a question
21/06/2020, 14:00 - Andrew: i'll do the code myself üòé
21/06/2020, 14:01 - Andrew: but then stumble across something unforseen and give up and then use that webpage
