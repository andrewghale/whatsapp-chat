13/09/2019, 16:15 - Shakey China: Classical burger recipe:
Get a whole grain burger bun;
On one side put 15g of sunflower seeds and 10g of flax seeds and cover with 75g of Camembert cheese;
Now toast both sides under the grill;
Next smash half an avocado on the side with nothing on and then add a very small amount of blue cheese (20g);
Now add a high quality juicy burger patty on top of the avocado/blue cheese side;
Cut 2 cherry tomatoes and put on top of the burger patty in a 2 by 2 fashion;
Add a light amount of rocket salad;
Put the Camembert/seed side on top and push hard;
Demolish it like an animal.
13/09/2019, 16:21 - Jamzig: 'Demolish it like an animal'
13/09/2019, 16:21 - Jamzig: How very Shakey
13/09/2019, 16:21 - Jamzig: Sounds like a good recipe though!
13/09/2019, 16:28 - Shakey China: Seriously do try it. It makes any pub/restaurant in the UK look like a seagull shat in all their burgers, and makes Byron Burger look like a seagull with IBS shat in their burgers.
13/09/2019, 16:29 - Jamzig: That's a wonderful thought

03/10/2019, 16:34 - Shakey China: I'm pretty sure he'll end up in prison.
03/10/2019, 16:34 - Shakey China: I mean do you remember how seriously they take environmental matter at customs when you enter and exit Australia?
03/10/2019, 16:35 - Shakey China: Plus Australia has a maximum sentence of 6 years in prison for animal cruelty compared to the UK at only 6 months.
03/10/2019, 16:36 - Shakey China: Super City has even more stringent punishments.
03/10/2019, 16:41 - Jamzig: Haha! I forgot about supercity

03/10/2019, 16:42 - Shakey China: Everyone has to do a 45 minute spin class at 6:00 am

05/10/2019, 14:16 - Jamzig: Big bastard
05/10/2019, 14:16 - Jamzig: Apparently a lot of them have cross bred with domestic cats so true wild Scottish cats are allegedly quite rare
05/10/2019, 14:19 - Shakey China: Yeah there's only about 200 of them in the wild
05/10/2019, 14:19 - Shakey China: Pretty sad
05/10/2019, 14:19 - Shakey China: 200 pure ones
05/10/2019, 14:20 - Shakey China: They are essentially the same species as domestic cat
05/10/2019, 14:21 - Shakey China: Just the domestic cat primary comes from the African wildcat and to a lesser extent the mainland European wildcat

05/10/2019, 16:03 - Shakey China: These letters need a confidence boost
05/10/2019, 16:04 - Andrew: pterodactyl is a common word in everyday conversation, it comes up a lot
05/10/2019, 16:05 - Shakey China: I'm gonna try and up my usage of pterodactyl now. Need to use this word at least every 10 minutes I think
05/10/2019, 16:07 - Niall Barber: I imagine you‚Äôll say that fart was smellier than a pterodactyls shit
05/10/2019, 16:07 - Dana: Pterodactyl‚Äôs poo for alliteration

05/10/2019, 16:09 - Shakey China: needed
05/10/2019, 16:10 - Shakey China: I sent Frontier Developments a list of 16 things that needs looking at
05/10/2019, 16:10 - Dana: Nice, give us the top 3
05/10/2019, 16:10 - Niall Barber: More pterodactyls
05/10/2019, 16:11 - Shakey China: Fences that won't build because the space is blocked
05/10/2019, 16:11 - Shakey China: Animals walk through fences
05/10/2019, 16:12 - Shakey China: The water buffalo got stuck in the water
05/10/2019, 16:12 - Dana: Feels kinda crucial that that shouldn‚Äôt happen
05/10/2019, 16:12 - Shakey China: Hahaha

05/10/2019, 16:14 - Shakey China: I think Zoo Tycoon 2 might still win over
05/10/2019, 16:14 - Dana: Can you have marine animals and Dinos in planet zoo?
05/10/2019, 16:14 - Shakey China: that'll have to be a DLC
05/10/2019, 16:15 - Dana: Hopefully
05/10/2019, 16:15 - Shakey China: tbh there are loads of 3D animal objects you can download for Planet Coaster
05/10/2019, 16:15 - Shakey China: I already did that and built some animal enclosures in my theme parks
05/10/2019, 16:16 - Shakey China: Give Planet Zoo a year or so and hopefully it'll be good
05/10/2019, 16:16 - Shakey China: also when the animals sit down their legs down align with the terrain
05/10/2019, 16:16 - Shakey China: so when they sit on a slope they look like they're floating in the air a bit
05/10/2019, 16:17 - Dana: Haha
05/10/2019, 16:17 - Dana: Im excited for when they sort it out :)
05/10/2019, 16:17 - Shakey China: especially funny for the snow leopard when it sat on a super slope
05/10/2019, 16:18 - Shakey China: I wish they could add some smaller walls and building blocks too

On the other side one whole avocado topped with ground pepper and sliced olives and covered with a sliced tomato.

25/11/2019, 20:35 - Jamzig: I'm tempted to get it myself
25/11/2019, 20:40 - Joe James: It's brilliant
25/11/2019, 20:41 - Joe James: In case you're not aware, google something like "blasphemous cd key" and choose whichever is cheapest
25/11/2019, 20:41 - Joe James: Allkeyshop is a steam key comparison website, prob easiest using that
25/11/2019, 20:42 - Joe James: You'll have to be prepared for a steep learning curve. It can be very frustrating early on.

09/12/2019, 20:57 - Niall Barber: Probably the trench coat

I have spoken to some of you previously about my struggles with depression. For the last few months I have been in great pain. Last night I had a breakdown and along with it this intense desire to leave the country as soon as possible.
10/12/2019, 17:26 - Joe James: I'm telling you all of this now because I can't keep it to myself anymore. I'll explode again like I did last night.
10/12/2019, 17:26 - Joe James: I am safe and have hope to finally overcome this in future.
10/12/2019, 18:25 - Kieran Sweden: Dude. Sorry to hear this! Hope Prague helps massively man. Enjoy!
10/12/2019, 19:45 - Joe James: Thanks man, i'm sure it will
11/12/2019, 19:21 - Kieran Sweden: I have a friend going to Prague. Since you're in Prague now Joe is there any recommendations as to what to do there?
11/12/2019, 19:25 - Jamzig: Sedlec Ossuary is pretty mad
11/12/2019, 19:26 - Andrew: is that the skulls place?
11/12/2019, 19:26 - Jamzig: A small chapel decorated with tens of thousands of bones
11/12/2019, 19:26 - Jamzig: Yeah
11/12/2019, 19:26 - Jamzig: Obviously check out the local historic sites
11/12/2019, 19:27 - Jamzig: Drink Czech beer
11/12/2019, 19:27 - Joe James: Friend of man with depression recommends church made of human bones
11/12/2019, 19:28 - Joe James: XD
11/12/2019, 19:28 - Jamzig: It's cool!
11/12/2019, 19:28 - Joe James: I've been before, thank you for the tip anyway
11/12/2019, 19:30 - Joe James: I was actually left feeling cold by it strangely enough. The visual spectacle I could logically conclude was impressive, it didn't move me in anyway. I was very surprised at the reaction or lack of it. I had been looking forward to seeing it and it seemed exactly the sort or thing that would interest me.
11/12/2019, 19:31 - Niall Barber: Wasn't it an hour drive away from Prague as well?
11/12/2019, 19:31 - Niall Barber: Seemed very anti-climactic
11/12/2019, 19:32 - Jamzig: Yeah a bit of a trek
11/12/2019, 19:33 - Joe James: At the time and now, I didn't feel like it was a lack of feeling in a shocked way if that makes sense? I still entertain the possibility nonetheless that I was instinctively putting distance away from the obvious connotations as some kind of self-defence mechanism.
11/12/2019, 19:34 - Kieran Sweden: Anything else?
11/12/2019, 19:35 - Kieran Sweden: What else have you done today man?
11/12/2019, 19:38 - Jamzig: I didn't find particularly shocking either, i mean i was trying to count how many knee bones there was and i could hear Moo giggling behind me
11/12/2019, 19:38 - Jamzig: So i assume he didn't either
11/12/2019, 19:43 - Joe James: Could just be it's not that interesting a spectacle then. It's a very famous and cherished site. Maybe has more impact on the spiritually minded?
11/12/2019, 19:48 - Joe James: Keiran, I recommend the old town area including the old town square, King Charles bridge and Jewish quarter. I took in those places via an excellent free walking tour and would encourage anyone to see them.
11/12/2019, 19:48 - Joe James: Prague Castle comes highly recommended. It deserves having an entire day and budget set aside for it. The cathedral in the castle grounds in particular is an incredible sight to behold.
11/12/2019, 19:50 - Joe James: I did all of those things a few years back when I first visited. Today I did a whole load of not much in particular cycling between cafes with a book. It's been a very good day.
11/12/2019, 19:53 - Dana: That‚Äôs my fave kind of touristing
11/12/2019, 21:30 - Kieran Sweden: Awesome! Thanks man! Have forwarded this on to friend who is going there soon....forget when
11/12/2019, 21:31 - Kieran Sweden: Niiiiice!!! Always got to cycle! So many bikes here...just I have to avoid getting pulled over again!

12/12/2019, 23:04 - Joe James: Had the pleasure of meeting Labour at a charity do once. It was surprisingly down to earth, and VERY funny.

13/12/2019, 07:32 - Jamzig: I cocked up my vote in Woking, the consensus was that labour were the 2nd most popular party, but twice as many people here voted lib dem
13/12/2019, 07:32 - Joe James: I'm finding it hard to process right now
13/12/2019, 07:32 - Jamzig: If everyone who voted labour switched to voting lib dem then this would have been a contested constituency with a small margin
13/12/2019, 07:33 - Jamzig: Unrealistic of course, but i saw different suggestions from tactical voting sites.
13/12/2019, 07:33 - Jamzig: Aah you told me on the phone it would be a Tory majority, you correctly predicted so
13/12/2019, 07:34 - Joe James: Still tough to see it happen even if it's not a surprise
13/12/2019, 07:34 - Jamzig: Yeah true
13/12/2019, 07:34 - Dana: Let‚Äôs just all nope out to Scotland and chill with Nicola
13/12/2019, 07:34 - Jamzig: It seems that lib dems were doing quite well in Surrey area
13/12/2019, 07:36 - Jamzig: You know how a cloud appears in England sometime in late october and doesn't go away until april?
13/12/2019, 07:36 - Jamzig: That cloud only goes away 1 month a year in Scotland
13/12/2019, 07:36 - Jamzig: And @447539241342 if you walk through the local parks at night you stumble across toothless homeless men sucking each other off
13/12/2019, 07:37 - Dana: Well I guess I‚Äôm glad I was granted settled status yesterday so Boris cant get rid of me :D
13/12/2019, 07:37 - Jamzig: Oh nice!
13/12/2019, 07:37 - Jamzig: Good for you
13/12/2019, 07:37 - Jamzig: Now pick up a pint and start bitching about socialism and foreigners
13/12/2019, 07:37 - Jamzig: And get up a st george' flag outside your flat
13/12/2019, 07:38 - Dana: Hard-left socialism suffered a major defeat tonight hurrah! Off with immigrants! üè¥Û†ÅßÛ†Å¢Û†Å•Û†ÅÆÛ†ÅßÛ†Åø
13/12/2019, 07:38 - Jamzig: Excellent. You are learning well
13/12/2019, 07:38 - Jamzig: At some point you need to pick up a gambling habit, but we'll take things slow
13/12/2019, 07:39 - Dana: Like the nation have gambled with the country‚Äôs future????!!!!
13/12/2019, 07:44 - Jamzig: No you need to go further than that
13/12/2019, 07:45 - Niall Barber: I remember 2010 when I was excited to cast my first vote and my dad said to me "get ready for a lifetime of disappointment"
13/12/2019, 07:45 - Niall Barber: He woz right
13/12/2019, 07:46 - Jamzig: Like how we're all gambling with the future of mankind by pretending everything is ok and pumping out copious amounts of c02 and equivalents despite warnings that it could have some catastrophic effects
13/12/2019, 07:46 - Jamzig: Haha so true.
13/12/2019, 07:47 - Dana: I recon lads in 10 years or so we will have a Labour + smaller party government ... hopefully....
13/12/2019, 07:49 - Jamzig: With Jeremy Corbyn resigning labour could go back to a Tory-lite Blaire-esque direction
13/12/2019, 07:49 - Jamzig: Or they might get even more radical
13/12/2019, 07:49 - Dana: Has he resigned yet?
13/12/2019, 07:50 - Jamzig: Not yet, but won't be running as leader for the next general election
13/12/2019, 07:51 - Dana: Hopefully someone voteable shows up
13/12/2019, 07:52 - Jamzig: I saw an article stating that and independent group researched every parties official campaigns and found that 88% of Tories campaigning points were either false or misleading, compared to none of labours (official) points
13/12/2019, 07:52 - Andrew: just woke up
13/12/2019, 07:52 - Andrew: oh goddd
13/12/2019, 07:52 - Jamzig: That's what i want to hear about now
13/12/2019, 07:52 - Andrew: oh god no
13/12/2019, 07:52 - Jamzig: Haha good morning Moo
13/12/2019, 07:52 - Andrew: please god no
13/12/2019, 07:52 - Jamzig: Boris Johnson is taking us into a hard brexit with a Tory majority
13/12/2019, 07:53 - Andrew: üòß
13/12/2019, 07:53 - Jamzig: And yes you have woken up. This isn't a dream
13/12/2019, 07:53 - Andrew: nooooo
13/12/2019, 07:53 - Niall Barber: It was always going to happen though
13/12/2019, 07:53 - Andrew: yeah but i dreamed the lib dems had won
13/12/2019, 07:53 - Jamzig: To be fair. No it wasn't, but that's the media narrative that os created to make people feel that way
13/12/2019, 07:54 - Joe James: Congratulations!
13/12/2019, 07:56 - Niall Barber: You think Labour or Lib dems stood a chance? I thought maybe a hung parliament at best, but didn't really think
13/12/2019, 07:56 - Jamzig: A hung parliament could have been possible yes, the margin of error in the polls suggested so
13/12/2019, 07:57 - Niall Barber: I was hoping the polls would be off, but checking last night they've been very accurate unfortunately in the last 20 years apart from the off election
13/12/2019, 07:58 - Jamzig: But when one party can get away with lying through their teeth and putting up posters the on election day about Corbyn being a terrorist sympathiser (in case you haven't heard) then they'll always have an advantage
13/12/2019, 07:58 - Niall Barber: Ah yeah and then the tory party HQ changing their name to fact check uk. Insane what they get away with
13/12/2019, 07:59 - Niall Barber: On twitter that is
13/12/2019, 07:59 - Niall Barber: And got told "don't do that again"
13/12/2019, 08:00 - Jamzig: Yup they even made a www.labourmanifesto.co.uk/
13/12/2019, 08:00 - Jamzig: Which they then had to change to declare it id a website by the conservative party
13/12/2019, 08:01 - Jamzig: It didn't until people start conplaining
13/12/2019, 08:01 - Jamzig: Plus all of the dodgey Russian oligarch money
13/12/2019, 08:01 - Jamzig: Been a very election campaign
13/12/2019, 08:02 - Jamzig: *very dodgey
13/12/2019, 08:04 - Jamzig: 'Gove says he has a message for a special group of British people: the Jewish community. He tells them they have had to live in fear of a Corbyn government. ‚ÄúYou should never have to live in fear again,‚Äù he says'
13/12/2019, 08:05 - Jamzig: Ouch
13/12/2019, 08:05 - Niall Barber: Rachel Riley will be very happy
13/12/2019, 08:05 - Shakey China: Bloody jews
13/12/2019, 08:06 - Andrew: üòê
13/12/2019, 08:06 - Shakey China: They should share their jew gold though
13/12/2019, 08:06 - Joe James: Bloody Moos
13/12/2019, 08:07 - Shakey China: I'm getting my Irish passport
13/12/2019, 08:08 - Shakey China: I love how people think it's such a fair system when although we get to vote, we actually don't have a single say in how everything is set up and organised in the first place.
13/12/2019, 08:09 - Jamzig: Oh here we go, Shakey's turned into a communist
13/12/2019, 08:09 - Jamzig: (I joke)
13/12/2019, 08:09 - Jamzig: I agree
13/12/2019, 08:09 - Shakey China: Hahaha
13/12/2019, 08:09 - Jamzig: First past the post will always mean you don't really have much choice in the leaders
13/12/2019, 08:10 - Jamzig: So you have Irish in your family?
13/12/2019, 08:11 - Shakey China: Yep, my Gran
13/12/2019, 08:11 - Shakey China: I suggest everyone vacates the UK sooner than later
13/12/2019, 08:12 - Niall Barber: Doesn't it have to be your parent to get an Irish passport?
13/12/2019, 08:12 - Shakey China: Grandparent
13/12/2019, 08:12 - Niall Barber: Ah lucky!
13/12/2019, 08:12 - Shakey China: Parent for most nationalities
13/12/2019, 08:12 - Shakey China: For British it's even stricter of course
13/12/2019, 08:13 - Shakey China: I've gotta save 65,000 pounds to bring my girlfriend  back
13/12/2019, 08:14 - Niall Barber: Wait why?
13/12/2019, 08:16 - Shakey China: Because I'm not a resident so there are 2 options and one involves going back and waiting 6 months on my own in the UK before she can come
13/12/2019, 08:16 - Shakey China: The other involves 65,000 pounds in savings
13/12/2019, 08:16 - Shakey China: Theresa Bitchbard May did that
13/12/2019, 08:17 - Shakey China: For Ireland it's only 25,000 Euros in savings to take her there
13/12/2019, 08:19 - Joe James: 'Only'
13/12/2019, 08:21 - Shakey China: United States is surprisingly only $15,000
13/12/2019, 08:21 - Shakey China: Easy
13/12/2019, 08:23 - Shakey China: I guess nobody voted for Baron Von Thunderclap this time
13/12/2019, 08:23 - Shakey China: Monster Raving Loony
13/12/2019, 08:25 - Niall Barber: Their brexit policy was: "We will Send Noel Edmonds to negotiate Brexit because he understands Deal or No Deal.
There will be no need for a backstop to the Brexit negotiations. We‚Äôll have Alec Stewart as wicket-keeper."
13/12/2019, 08:27 - Shakey China: It connects more to the real world compared to Boris' idea
13/12/2019, 08:28 - Shakey China: I like the conciseness of the plan
13/12/2019, 08:36 - Jamzig: Hahhaa fucking brilliant
13/12/2019, 08:37 - Jamzig: That has cheered me up
13/12/2019, 08:38 - Jamzig: It's expensive enough having a girlfriend who already lives in the uk
13/12/2019, 08:38 - Jamzig: Girlfriend tax and all that
13/12/2019, 08:38 - Jamzig: But that is taking the piss
13/12/2019, 08:38 - Jamzig: Any idea where that money goes?
13/12/2019, 08:41 - Kieran Sweden: Came here for the Shakey comments
13/12/2019, 08:41 - Kieran Sweden: Not disappointed
13/12/2019, 08:46 - Kieran Sweden: Maybe thats what labour fucked up on. Make their own real manifesto then make fake ones for tories and smear all the leaders 'good' names
13/12/2019, 08:47 - Kieran Sweden: Then you get both labour and tory voters
13/12/2019, 08:49 - Shakey China: You just need it in your bank account to prove you have enough money to survive in a country where 65% of your train ticket fee goes straight to rich shareholders who then buy silk underwear.
13/12/2019, 08:51 - Kieran Sweden: https://www.bbc.com/news/election-2019-50766014
13/12/2019, 08:51 - Kieran Sweden: Perhaps move to Scotland, vote for independence and let Engerland sink
13/12/2019, 09:17 - Joe James: You loved voting leave so much you'll move country to do it again?
13/12/2019, 09:26 - Jamzig: Me? Or Barry?
13/12/2019, 09:27 - Joe James: I thought we all voted leave?
13/12/2019, 09:28 - Niall Barber: Brexit means brexit
13/12/2019, 09:29 - Niall Barber: Means brexit means brexit
13/12/2019, 09:33 - Jamzig: My plan:
13/12/2019, 09:34 - Jamzig: Scotland leaves.
I become a border guard at Hadrian's wall as a hard border has to be created
13/12/2019, 09:34 - Jamzig: I smuggle people across the border utilising a step ladder and holding their hand as they clamber over
13/12/2019, 09:34 - Jamzig: Then charge them ¬£1000 per person
13/12/2019, 09:52 - Kieran Sweden: Me, no. I just left
13/12/2019, 09:53 - Kieran Sweden: Made it an individual thang
13/12/2019, 09:53 - Kieran Sweden: I left the leavers?
13/12/2019, 09:53 - Kieran Sweden: I shot the sheriff
13/12/2019, 10:35 - Jamzig: Guy at work, spent weeks in hospital a few years ago and was treated by the nhs. Parents lived in social housing and recieved benefits. Went to uni for free, voted Tory yesterday
13/12/2019, 10:36 - Jamzig: 'Thanks for the socialism guys, but now that i've got my house and my savings you lot can go fuck yourselves'
13/12/2019, 10:41 - Joe James: It's part of class mobility
13/12/2019, 10:41 - Shakey China: He should be sent to a forest to chop down trees
13/12/2019, 10:43 - Joe James: I'm not making a joke or purposely glib comment. Labour are the party of the poor, Conservatives of the rich. When one moves along the spectrum their vote can change in the motion.
13/12/2019, 10:47 - Jamzig: Just strikes me as incredibly selfish
13/12/2019, 10:48 - Jamzig: I can understand families from well off backgrounds or business owners
13/12/2019, 10:48 - Jamzig: But people who have come out of poverty under labours policies?
13/12/2019, 10:49 - Shakey China: Next time he goes to hospital and the US big pharma have raided the UK and disbanded the NHS he'll realise
13/12/2019, 10:53 - Joe James: What's wrong with being selfish? What's right about caring for those of the deprived?
13/12/2019, 10:56 - Shakey China: There should be some aspect of survival of the fittest to push people to help society. That's the biggest thing that's missing. I link survival of the fittest with helping society because that's how it should be. The current system is based on survival of who can get the most money by being a corrupt dickhead.
13/12/2019, 10:58 - Jamzig: Being selfish is fine, but benefiting from a system that helps the deprived and then turning your back on others who are deprived is fairly sociopathic in a sense. Morality aside if you ignore the deprived for long enough the shit hits the fan as is evident in many countries around the world at the moment
13/12/2019, 10:59 - Jamzig: Actually i should clarify: voting to remove the advantages that you have had for future generations is the selfish part
13/12/2019, 11:09 - Jamzig: I haven't thought into this all that much to be fair, i'm just salty this morning
14/12/2019, 15:28 - Andrew: (Media omitted)
14/12/2019, 17:08 - Jamzig: Aww kevin
14/12/2019, 17:08 - Jamzig: Will is pretty ill. He has kidney failure and has lost loads of weight
14/12/2019, 18:24 - Andrew: :(
14/12/2019, 18:58 - Joe James: I'm sorry to hear that
14/12/2019, 19:45 - Jamzig: He's still a happy cat though
14/12/2019, 20:25 - Joe James: Please give him plenty of head rubs
16/12/2019, 12:26 - Andrew: https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-wiltshire-50781511
16/12/2019, 12:26 - Andrew: breaking news
16/12/2019, 12:28 - Jamzig: Aww
16/12/2019, 12:28 - Jamzig: Some nice news for once
16/12/2019, 12:29 - Jamzig: I bet there is one crusty cum sock in there amongst the bunch
16/12/2019, 13:46 - Joe James: I bet they voted Tory
16/12/2019, 15:46 - Jamzig: The chipmunks?
16/12/2019, 15:52 - Joe James: Yes
16/12/2019, 15:54 - Jamzig: I'd imagine the chipmunk's are in a communist utopia. They share socks, food and space
16/12/2019, 15:54 - Jamzig: If a chipmink steps out of line it goes to chipmunk re-education camp
16/12/2019, 15:54 - Shakey China: Absolutely
16/12/2019, 15:56 - Jamzig: If a group of the chipmunks tries to break away from the group and defect to squirrel-ville they are arrested and sent to the interrogation room for being capitalist squirrel spies
16/12/2019, 15:57 - Jamzig: The squirrels you see, don't like to share and hide their wealth (acorns) in offshore secret accounts (the ground)
16/12/2019, 15:57 - Jamzig: They are morally bankrupt
17/12/2019, 13:42 - Joe James: (Media omitted)
17/12/2019, 14:33 - Andrew: the fuck
17/12/2019, 14:34 - Andrew: that is hella gay
17/12/2019, 14:51 - Niall Barber: Is this what lads do?
17/12/2019, 17:15 - Andrew: it certainly seems like it
17/12/2019, 17:15 - Andrew: we must be dysfunctional males
17/12/2019, 18:30 - Jamzig: Of course it's a fucking rugby club
17/12/2019, 18:30 - Jamzig: I love it though
17/12/2019, 18:30 - Jamzig: Niall hates lads
17/12/2019, 18:30 - Jamzig: Not ladz though
17/12/2019, 19:06 - Niall Barber: God hates ladz
19/12/2019, 19:46 - Dana: https://v.redd.it/7ao3pp79vu441
19/12/2019, 20:31 - Jamzig: Reddits video player is awful
19/12/2019, 20:32 - Jamzig: Ok got it working
19/12/2019, 20:32 - Jamzig: That dog got STRETCHED
19/12/2019, 20:32 - Dana: EEEEEEEEEE
20/12/2019, 16:07 - Jamzig: Did an explosive loud fart in the toilets and i think the managing director heard.
20/12/2019, 16:07 - Jamzig: Ermegerd guys what do i do
20/12/2019, 16:07 - Niall Barber: Quite
20/12/2019, 16:07 - Niall Barber: Quit
20/12/2019, 16:07 - Andrew: yeah change career
20/12/2019, 16:10 - Dana: Blame the dog
20/12/2019, 16:14 - Jamzig: Maybe i should sneak out the back and leave the country
20/12/2019, 16:14 - Jamzig: Does it make it worse that i'm childish enough to giggle at my own farts?
20/12/2019, 16:14 - Jamzig: And he may have heard that too
20/12/2019, 16:14 - Jamzig: Oh lawdy
21/12/2019, 13:54 - Dana: (Media omitted)
21/12/2019, 14:00 - Shakey China: I farted at the ticket barrier area in the underground. Loads of commuters got caught in the gas cloud and my girlfriend shat herself in laughter.
21/12/2019, 14:25 - Niall Barber: Haha she sounds perfect for you
21/12/2019, 14:25 - Jamzig: She does sound perfect
21/12/2019, 14:25 - Niall Barber: How flatulent would you say she is?
21/12/2019, 14:25 - Niall Barber: Is she just female Shakey?
21/12/2019, 14:26 - Jamzig: Do i spy some gingerbread tits and dick'n'balls?
21/12/2019, 14:26 - Jamzig: I can see why Niall likes you
21/12/2019, 14:26 - Jamzig: 10/10 would eat Dana's dick
21/12/2019, 14:27 - Niall Barber: It‚Äôs tasty!
22/12/2019, 19:16 - Joe James: Fucking hell! https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-sussex-50886322
22/12/2019, 19:18 - Andrew: yeeah :/
22/12/2019, 19:21 - Jamzig: it's about a 3 min walk from my parents house. Nasty business
22/12/2019, 19:21 - Jamzig: No idea who lived there though
22/12/2019, 20:29 - Niall Barber: (Media omitted)
22/12/2019, 20:38 - Andrew: aaaaaw
22/12/2019, 20:38 - Andrew: knew it would be her before i opened it :p
22/12/2019, 20:43 - Jamzig: is she happy to see you?
22/12/2019, 21:14 - Niall Barber: Dana‚Äôs playing with her non-stop so she‚Äôs having the time of her life
22/12/2019, 21:14 - Niall Barber: (Media omitted)
22/12/2019, 21:24 - Jamzig: oh yeah she is a feminist dog though. Hates men
23/12/2019, 19:20 - Joe James: I will be in the sussex arms from around 9 tomorrow
23/12/2019, 19:20 - Joe James: *9pm
23/12/2019, 19:29 - Jamzig: I guess i'll be there also
23/12/2019, 19:30 - Niall Barber: I can be there for a bit, but god it‚Äôs such a horrible pub :P
23/12/2019, 19:30 - Andrew: wish I was there lads
23/12/2019, 19:31 - Andrew: actually wait, not at the ship
23/12/2019, 19:31 - Andrew: or sussex*
23/12/2019, 19:33 - Jamzig: Look at you bourgeoisie with your fancy golden shoes and your unwillingness to associated with the poor
23/12/2019, 19:33 - Niall Barber: I prefer to stay away from the riff raff
23/12/2019, 19:34 - Dana: And go to spoons instead
23/12/2019, 19:34 - Andrew: wooo spoons
23/12/2019, 19:36 - Jamzig: The chef in spoons uses his warm sweaty armpits to cook the food in east grinstead spoons
23/12/2019, 19:56 - Joe James: Sussex is indeed a shithole. I still like it oddly.
23/12/2019, 20:16 - Jamzig: It's the sweet aroma of piss in there which is enticing
23/12/2019, 21:44 - Andrew: (Media omitted)
23/12/2019, 21:47 - Niall Barber: The Kevmeister
23/12/2019, 21:48 - Andrew: (Media omitted)
23/12/2019, 21:48 - Andrew: he meows louder than he used to
23/12/2019, 21:51 - Jamzig: Oh Will went deaf years ago, does he meow into corners now?
23/12/2019, 21:55 - Andrew: not yet, but he gets startled quite often apparently
23/12/2019, 22:03 - Jamzig: If you can convince your family to i'd recommend getting him onto a renal diet early
23/12/2019, 22:03 - Jamzig: If he's going to end up anything like Will
25/12/2019, 15:37 - Joe James: (Media omitted)
25/12/2019, 15:37 - Dana: Awww thanks Joe you superstar, the grey one is mine!

26/12/2019, 00:23 - Andrew: got an absolutely cracking joke to tell you all soon
26/12/2019, 08:42 - Jamzig: Plz tell
26/12/2019, 13:16 - Andrew: why did the mansplainer drown in a puddle?
26/12/2019, 13:16 - Andrew: it was a Well actually
26/12/2019, 13:17 - Andrew: that wasn't the one I had in mind but I liked that one too
26/12/2019, 13:48 - Jamzig: Hurrhurr
26/12/2019, 13:48 - Jamzig: I like it
26/12/2019, 15:28 - Andrew: I've eaten way too much cheese
28/12/2019, 14:28 - Niall Barber added K Boy
30/12/2019, 13:29 - K Boy: (Media omitted)
30/12/2019, 13:31 - Shakey China: Lol I made something pretty similar today
30/12/2019, 13:33 - Shakey China: Used wholegrain walnut bread with olive oil, avocado, ground pepper and thyme on the top side and steamed bacon, tomatoes and green pepper on the other side.
30/12/2019, 14:35 - Jamzig: I hope that avocado was SMASHED and not blended
30/12/2019, 16:06 - K Boy: No idea. Didnt make it myself
30/12/2019, 16:16 - Shakey China: Anyone who blends avocado should face unforeseen punishment
30/12/2019, 16:17 - K Boy: Hahah always the best lines shakey
30/12/2019, 16:18 - Shakey China: I make these kinda lines in class when I get my students to roleplay. They go wild for it
30/12/2019, 16:20 - K Boy: Hahaha, brilliant
30/12/2019, 16:20 - Shakey China: unforeseen in German is unvorhergesehen
30/12/2019, 16:20 - Shakey China: That's why the word gives out such a sinister feel
30/12/2019, 16:22 - K Boy: Do you tell them all this in class?
30/12/2019, 16:22 - K Boy: And now for shakey fun facts
30/12/2019, 16:23 - Shakey China: I played a game where they had to work out the English sentence from the German
30/12/2019, 16:23 - Shakey China: Obviously I have to make sure all the English words in this game are of Germanic origin
30/12/2019, 16:23 - Shakey China: Or at least most
30/12/2019, 16:24 - Shakey China: We've been roleplaying Home Alone for the last 2 weeks
30/12/2019, 16:25 - Shakey China: The kids have to act out getting smashed on the head with irons and grabbing potently hot door knobs
30/12/2019, 16:40 - K Boy: Crackin film
31/12/2019, 21:42 - Dana: (Media omitted)
31/12/2019, 21:46 - Jamzig: Oh no! Not that game!
31/12/2019, 21:46 - Jamzig: Blaaady mental
31/12/2019, 21:47 - Jamzig: I hope you're not playing Jo
31/12/2019, 21:54 - K Boy: Mooooo
01/01/2020, 00:08 - Joe James: Merry Christmas!
01/01/2020, 00:08 - Andrew: Av a proper crimbo

01/01/2020, 10:24 - Jamzig: Are these your mates?
01/01/2020, 10:24 - Jamzig: Why are you dressed so smart
01/01/2020, 10:24 - Jamzig: I want answers
01/01/2020, 10:36 - Shakey China: Hahaha
01/01/2020, 10:36 - Shakey China: I didn't buy any casual trousers in China
01/01/2020, 10:36 - Shakey China: So the only choice I had was to wear my work clothes haha
01/01/2020, 10:36 - Shakey China: And my girlfriend taught me how to dress like this
01/01/2020, 10:37 - Shakey China: It wasn't an easy job for her
01/01/2020, 11:00 - Jamzig: Good job Shakey's girlfriend!
01/01/2020, 12:40 - Dana: (Media omitted)
01/01/2020, 14:32 - Shakey China: Looks damn good!
Are you gonna attempt to pick that up with your hands?
01/01/2020, 14:34 - Dana: Yeah there was quite a bit of picking mushrooms up with hands
01/01/2020, 14:44 - Jamzig: Unimpressed. Avocado not smashed enough
01/01/2020, 14:45 - Dana: Wasn‚Äôt quite ripe enough :(
01/01/2020, 14:46 - Shakey China: At university I used to aggressively mix scrambled eggs and beans on the toast and then attempt to pick it up with my hands
02/01/2020, 18:24 - Dana: Joe and Moo if you fancy go karting tomorrow at 8:30pm there‚Äôs still spaces available - https://booking.team-sport.co.uk/
02/01/2020, 18:25 - Dana: It‚Äôs 3x15 mins :)
02/01/2020, 19:10 - Jamzig: That is the most Shakey thing i can think of
02/01/2020, 19:10 - Jamzig: The sulphur of the eggs and the gas of the beans
03/01/2020, 07:43 - Shakey China: Exactly haha. Use to have 4 eggs and a shit ton of beans
03/01/2020, 07:43 - Shakey China: so amazing
03/01/2020, 07:43 - Shakey China: I should start doing that again here
03/01/2020, 07:44 - Shakey China: I'll get some garlic and onions involved, too
03/01/2020, 07:53 - Jamzig: Are the Chinese big on garlic and onions?
03/01/2020, 07:53 - Jamzig: I know they use all sorts of vegetables that are more native to that part of the world
03/01/2020, 07:54 - Jamzig: Pak choi is very tasty
03/01/2020, 08:03 - Shakey China: For sure
03/01/2020, 08:04 - Shakey China: Pak Choi and Morning Glory
03/01/2020, 08:04 - Shakey China: Amazing
03/01/2020, 08:04 - Shakey China: Fried in peanut oil with a ton of garlic
03/01/2020, 08:04 - Shakey China: The Chinese are definitely big on garlic
03/01/2020, 08:04 - Shakey China: Onions not so much
03/01/2020, 08:05 - Shakey China: They believe that meat must always be eaten with garlic because the garlic fights the bad toxins in the meat
03/01/2020, 08:18 - Jamzig: Interesting
03/01/2020, 08:18 - Jamzig: 'I'd pak choi with my morning glory' - ancient Chinese proverb
03/01/2020, 13:18 - Kieran Sweden: Jesus shakey. She's worse than you!
03/01/2020, 14:03 - Joe James: Won't be able to make karting sorry :(
03/01/2020, 19:44 - Niall Barber: (Media omitted)
03/01/2020, 19:47 - Jamzig: That looks like a very wide track
03/01/2020, 22:25 - Dana: It was much fun :)
03/01/2020, 23:33 - Niall Barber: Twas fantastic!
04/01/2020, 00:27 - Kieran Sweden: Hoo wun?
04/01/2020, 09:16 - Dana: Some loser, there was 18 of us, but guess who came last üòé
04/01/2020, 13:57 - Dana: (Media omitted)
04/01/2020, 16:34 - Jamzig: 'Protesters break into Australia Prime Minister Scott Morrison‚Äôs home and vow to ‚Äòs*** in his pool‚Äô over wildfire outrage'
04/01/2020, 16:35 - Jamzig: https://www.thesun.co.uk/news/10665312/home-australia-prime-minister-scott-morrison-smashed-up-fire-resign/
04/01/2020, 16:35 - Jamzig: Excuse the source, but this is great news
04/01/2020, 16:46 - Kieran Sweden: what is the deal here btw? Is it that he's doing nothing or that he is just someone to blame?
04/01/2020, 17:00 - Jamzig: Him and all previously Auss politicians have been mining and selling coal to China despite being a country with infinite sunshine and 90% un-used land
04/01/2020, 17:01 - Jamzig: Morrison in particular bought coal into parliament to show 'how harmless it is'
04/01/2020, 17:01 - Andrew: yeah current ozzie PM is bloody useless
04/01/2020, 17:01 - Andrew: source: my australian housemate Luke
04/01/2020, 17:01 - Jamzig: He's also a climate change denier and has been completely inactive to help out the bushfires. Last i heard he also refused to pay volunteer firefighters
04/01/2020, 17:01 - Jamzig: Is he Australian?
04/01/2020, 17:02 - Jamzig: I thought he was British
04/01/2020, 17:05 - Andrew: old housemate ben is british
04/01/2020, 17:05 - Andrew: luke is from brisbane I think
04/01/2020, 17:05 - Andrew: the bushfires happen every year but they're more prolonged than usual
04/01/2020, 17:20 - Jamzig: Yeah that's true
04/01/2020, 17:21 - Jamzig: Although when you look at the scale of them so far it's pretty insane
04/01/2020, 18:34 - Kieran Sweden: this I have heard

09/01/2020, 19:34 - Kieran Sweden: Classic moo lines
10/01/2020, 18:26 - Jamzig: Does anybody have an old iphone lying around in a drawer somewhere? If so would you be willing to sell it?
10/01/2020, 18:27 - Jamzig: My housemate's iphone has died and a lot of his info should be backed up in iCloud backup
10/01/2020, 18:27 - Jamzig: I'm going to assume that apple won't let you sync that data with any other device
11/01/2020, 01:14 - Shakey China: I despise Apple
11/01/2020, 01:30 - Kieran Sweden: I too, despise Apple
11/01/2020, 07:57 - Jamzig: Apple the company are a joke, but their operating system is great ü§ì

13/01/2020, 08:24 - Niall Barber: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FMIZEfjYmtM
13/01/2020, 08:24 - Niall Barber: For all you java lovers
13/01/2020, 09:28 - Jamzig: I'm gonna guess a raspberry pi?
13/01/2020, 09:45 - Niall Barber: It's actually a blinmaker
13/01/2020, 09:48 - Jamzig: A what
13/01/2020, 10:00 - Kieran Sweden: Might need to learn java
13/01/2020, 10:56 - Jamzig: Java is a bit mental mental chicken oriental in my opinion
13/01/2020, 10:56 - Jamzig: It's pretty damn quick though
13/01/2020, 11:13 - Niall Barber: That video above is a gopnik making a java programme that lets him know how many blins he can make
13/01/2020, 11:13 - Niall Barber: Or something like that :P
13/01/2020, 11:14 - Niall Barber: I watched it and can follow along, but there seems to be loads more steps than a javascript program
13/01/2020, 11:17 - Jamzig: Did you know IBM used to pay contractors based on lines of code opposed to hours worked
13/01/2020, 11:17 - Jamzig: Back in the mid to late 80's i think
13/01/2020, 11:18 - Niall Barber: I bet they regretted that
13/01/2020, 11:19 - Niall Barber: The shear amount of spaghetti code they must've had to debug makes me queasy
13/01/2020, 11:38 - Jamzig: Yup
13/01/2020, 11:38 - Jamzig: Plus back then memory and storage on devices wasn't exactly cheap so bloating software can't have been popular
13/01/2020, 12:39 - Shakey China: Paid per line of code
13/01/2020, 12:39 - Shakey China: Reminds me of being paid per gigantic crate of oranges in Australia
13/01/2020, 13:20 - Jamzig: Except imagine if you would throw in some fake plastic oranges that couldn't be sold into the mix just to increase your numbers
13/01/2020, 13:20 - Jamzig: That's most likely what happened with the coding. Unnecessary logic that serves no purpose
13/01/2020, 13:32 - Jamzig: Interesting read if anyone cares for a break: https://www.theatlantic.com/international/archive/2020/01/jeremy-corbyn-labour-twitter-primary/604690/
13/01/2020, 13:32 - Jamzig: Interesting becaise the journalist is very left leaning
13/01/2020, 13:33 - Kieran Sweden: Watched some guy promoting brexit yesterday. Saying the EU officials get all these benefits. I swear all parliaments do, so why be a bitch about another set doing it.
13/01/2020, 13:33 - Jamzig: But explains part of the reason that vocal left wingers have had a hand in screwing over labour
13/01/2020, 13:34 - Kieran Sweden: Has Corbyn stepped down yet?
13/01/2020, 13:34 - Jamzig: House of Lords get paid to turn and fall asleep during parliament
13/01/2020, 13:34 - Kieran Sweden: Yeh, literally dont understand his point.
13/01/2020, 13:34 - Kieran Sweden: They all do it
13/01/2020, 13:35 - Jamzig: Not yet. Will probably be Keir Starmer replacing him as that is the media's choice
13/01/2020, 13:35 - Jamzig: Because whatever news he reads on facebook told him to be angry about this issue
13/01/2020, 13:36 - Jamzig: Been going on since 2016
13/01/2020, 13:36 - Jamzig: Targeted news ads
13/01/2020, 13:36 - Kieran Sweden: Yeh, dunno why I listened to it. Ended up listening to shit happening in mehico on the Joe Rogan show
13/01/2020, 13:36 - Kieran Sweden: Yeh, minimal fact checking
13/01/2020, 13:38 - Jamzig: Joe Rogan the man
13/01/2020, 13:38 - Jamzig: When he's not interviewing people when he's high
13/01/2020, 13:39 - Jamzig: Then it can get painful to listen to
13/01/2020, 13:39 - Kieran Sweden: Some are good
13/01/2020, 13:39 - Kieran Sweden: Its my fall asleep jam
13/01/2020, 21:44 - Kieran Sweden: How much do people know about java and javascript? Good places to learn or get started and maybe move onto projects?
13/01/2020, 21:44 - Niall Barber: I know very little about java, but know javascript
13/01/2020, 21:45 - Niall Barber: Did you try javascript before a couple of years ago?
13/01/2020, 21:45 - Kieran Sweden: A little
13/01/2020, 21:46 - Kieran Sweden: I'm just wondering if there is a good site to start learning from
13/01/2020, 21:46 - Joe James: Pluralsight is one of the best if you don't mind paying
13/01/2020, 21:46 - Kieran Sweden: Will try it whilst doing c
13/01/2020, 21:47 - Kieran Sweden: Saweet. Thanks man
13/01/2020, 21:48 - Joe James: I'd advise looking at C# instead of Java. It's Java without the rubbish bits and as far as i'm aware the exact same can be achieved.
13/01/2020, 21:49 - Kieran Sweden: Ok. Just seeing jobs here which utilise java and wanted to get an understanding of what it's all about
13/01/2020, 21:50 - Joe James: The Java language itself is piss easy. You can be writing a simple application very quickly if you have any prior coding experience.
13/01/2020, 21:51 - Joe James: Problem is the language uses a myriad of supporting technologies in almost all business contexts. You would rarely if ever be able to get knowing just the Java language to build anything meaningful.
13/01/2020, 21:53 - Dana: I think my boyfriend might know a bit of JavaScript, I‚Äôll check
13/01/2020, 21:53 - Joe James: The supporting techs are a nightmare to wrap your head around. They have all been designed expressly to build very large applications, which in practice means building even a simple application feels horriby verbose and complicated.
13/01/2020, 22:00 - Jamzig: Yeah i do get the feeling that java is for phat applications
13/01/2020, 22:02 - Jamzig: Tbh Barry i would avoid web development based languages if i were you
13/01/2020, 22:02 - Jamzig: You can command a much higher wage with languages used to build software
13/01/2020, 22:03 - Kieran Sweden: Imma take a look all the same since there are a buttload of programming jobs here, apparently more than people applying for them
13/01/2020, 22:03 - Andrew: the fuck
13/01/2020, 22:03 - Andrew: more jobs than people applying for them?
13/01/2020, 22:04 - Andrew: i've been looking for a junior web dev job for 7 months here
13/01/2020, 22:04 - Jamzig: Yeah that's been true
13/01/2020, 22:04 - Jamzig: Been true for a while country wide i mean
13/01/2020, 22:04 - Andrew: guess everyone wants to live and work in bristol
13/01/2020, 22:05 - Jamzig: It's all in London of course
13/01/2020, 22:09 - Kieran Sweden: Yeh, marc got the first job he applied for
13/01/2020, 22:10 - Jamzig: I assume in Sweden?
13/01/2020, 22:11 - Kieran Sweden: Yarp
13/01/2020, 22:12 - Kieran Sweden: Stockholm
13/01/2020, 22:12 - Jamzig: One thing i will say is pick a language and stick with it. Learning the principles of building stuff and problem solving will be very similar across all languages
13/01/2020, 22:12 - Jamzig: But you know this anyway
13/01/2020, 22:12 - Jamzig: Weren't you doing python?
13/01/2020, 22:15 - Kieran Sweden: I do
13/01/2020, 22:15 - Kieran Sweden: I was. I very much enjoy c though
13/01/2020, 22:15 - Kieran Sweden: Which I'm restarting next week
13/01/2020, 22:15 - Kieran Sweden: I will continue with R for other opportunities and a change
18/01/2020, 09:25 - Dana: Hey @447800771260 and @447539241342 do you fancy coming round for some food and PS4 today or tomorrow?

12/02/2020, 16:02 - Shakey China: It's not too bad here atm. Just gotta stay in our apartments really
12/02/2020, 16:03 - Shakey China: They have blocked all the entrances to the housing estates and are funneling everyone through a single entrance for each estate
12/02/2020, 16:04 - Shakey China: You have to scan a special bar code to get into your own apartment and if you have any fever like symptoms they will banish you to hospital
12/02/2020, 16:05 - Shakey China: And the supermarket has sold out of beef. That's the worst thing that has happened so far

12/02/2020, 16:42 - Shakey China: Absolutely, that's very true. On the contrast D flat major has a pretty hallucinogenic feeling to it.

12/02/2020, 17:11 - Shakey China: Blowing out another Symphony in B flat minor now. I think my girlfriend has passed out from the depressing smell

12/02/2020, 17:12 - Shakey China: I did a couple of times during her meeting this morning
12/02/2020, 17:13 - Shakey China: Since there are a few people in each meeting I guess it's covered up
12/02/2020, 17:13 - Shakey China: Who farted?!
12/02/2020, 17:14 - Shakey China: Who in the world created that obscene sound?!
12/02/2020, 17:32 - Jamzig: My god
12/02/2020, 17:32 - Jamzig: Wherever Shakey goes the world gets the impression that English people are incredibly flatulent

14/02/2020, 13:04 - Shakey China: Haha. She's cool with it
14/02/2020, 13:04 - Shakey China: I'm trying to get her to my level of gas passing
14/02/2020, 13:05 - Shakey China: Still a long way to go though
14/02/2020, 13:05 - Shakey China: I'm working on getting my farts to smell like gone off chicken yogurt
14/02/2020, 13:06 - Shakey China: Apologies if anyone needs a new phone after reading this
14/02/2020, 13:06 - Kieran Sweden: What the fuck even is that
14/02/2020, 13:06 - Kieran Sweden: I think beer is good enough for me
14/02/2020, 13:06 - Shakey China: It could be the worst flavoured fart in history
14/02/2020, 13:07 - Kieran Sweden: Room smells like several cats shat themselves
14/02/2020, 13:07 - Kieran Sweden: Mmm....so potent, you can taste it in the air
14/02/2020, 13:07 - Kieran Sweden: What colour is air in your apartment?
14/02/2020, 13:08 - Shakey China: Currently it's in a phase of turning between orange and green
14/02/2020, 13:08 - Shakey China: Must be going between the broccoli and carrots
14/02/2020, 13:09 - Kieran Sweden: A wonderful transition
14/02/2020, 13:25 - Jamzig: Considering leaving this group after this conversation
14/02/2020, 13:26 - Jamzig: Sabotaged by poop talk

14/02/2020, 13:26 - Shakey China: I can reframe if you want
14/02/2020, 13:34 - Jamzig: No feel free to discuss the farts
14/02/2020, 13:35 - Jamzig: Just remember that when your girlfriend is hospitalised from the stench these messages may incriminate you in court

16/02/2020, 14:20 - Shakey China: That was our dinner tonight, with beef and carrots
16/02/2020, 14:20 - Shakey China: Doesn't get more brutal
16/02/2020, 14:21 - Shakey China: When eating becomes an unnecessary challenge that it doesn't have to be
16/02/2020, 14:21 - Dana: I‚Äôve had those before, made the mistake of having them for lunch at work, was snotting and tearing up in the canteen
16/02/2020, 14:22 - Shakey China: Absolutely, I did a challenge once to eat these as fast as possible. I got 1 minutes and 50 seconds and then 2 minutes and 45 seconds for licking the bowl clean.
16/02/2020, 14:24 - Shakey China: I used to take absurdly spicy food to work in England but I got more looks for using the chopsticks in England than I did for not being able to handle my choice of food.
16/02/2020, 14:29 - Jamzig: It's because Shakey loves shitting napalm the following morning
16/02/2020, 14:29 - Kieran Sweden: Or just constantly
16/02/2020, 14:30 - Shakey China: I should tell you the shit story at my friends house in Korea.
16/02/2020, 14:34 - Shakey China: I literally ate so many vegetables, especially garlic and onions, and loads of chicken and all sorts of bad-shit-smells inducing foods. Then I crashed at my friends house over night.
Unfortunately for him he only has 1 bathroom.
But he knew that I would take a shit in it, so he deliberately hid the toilet paper.
But I also carry emergency toilet paper on me, so just as his alarm went off the next morning, because he had to go to work, I dash into his bathroom and took the god damn most horrendous smelling shit I've ever taken.
Then he had to take his shower and get ready for work while immersed in the smell.
16/02/2020, 14:49 - Kieran Sweden: Brilliant

19/02/2020, 12:48 - Kieran Sweden: Lol yeh. That'll do it
19/02/2020, 12:49 - Shakey China: Personally I would do garlic and whiskey
19/02/2020, 12:51 - Kieran Sweden: Is that the fartiest food?
19/02/2020, 12:52 - Shakey China: Then it'd have to be garlic and beers
19/02/2020, 12:52 - Shakey China: Or garlic, beer and sardines
19/02/2020, 12:52 - Shakey China: I'll never forget that episode
19/02/2020, 13:02 - Kieran Sweden: Explain
19/02/2020, 13:05 - Shakey China: I was working at Wakehurst the day after at a wedding, and the chemical reaction between these 3 ingredients just produced the most horrendous smells ever.
But to make sure noone thought it was me letting off the smells I kept farting when I was en route to another location whilst carry out a task.
19/02/2020, 13:06 - Shakey China: Caroline was trying to investigate who the culprit was but I always just managed to stay behind the curtain.
19/02/2020, 13:10 - Shakey China: Obviously I let out a silent but deadly one next to the wedding cake.
19/02/2020, 13:14 - Jamzig: Oh jesus christ

21/02/2020, 14:46 - Shakey China: There was this one time where a Korean girl at a hostel in Thailand called 2 English guys out for the way they were speaking. Every time they made a statement these guys would respond, "Oh, is it..."
21/02/2020, 14:47 - Shakey China: "There are lots of dumm Brits here."
"Oh, is it!"
21/02/2020, 14:48 - Shakey China: Dumb*

23/02/2020, 12:33 - Shakey China: Well I remember walking through the smelliest fishing yard in the world when I was in New Zealand, but I still managed to overpower the smell with my fart.
24/02/2020, 15:14 - Shakey China: Apparently there was a double murder in Crawley Down before Christmas. Anyone know what happened?
24/02/2020, 15:14 - Andrew: yeah it was big news
24/02/2020, 15:15 - Andrew: as far as i'm aware it was someone who had a psychotic episode, someone walking by came in to see what was going on and she got murdered too
24/02/2020, 15:18 - Shakey China: Yeah it seems like some guy had a psychotic episode and killed his wife and another old lady.
24/02/2020, 15:18 - Shakey China: Really strange
24/02/2020, 15:29 - Jamzig: Well i heard that the old woman who was walking by tried to intervene with him attacking his partner in the street and he beat her to death. Nasty stuff
24/02/2020, 15:31 - Shakey China: I wonder what makes someone flip out that bad
24/02/2020, 15:33 - Shakey China: Apparently UK armed police have brainwave scans now to make sure they won't loose control and pull the trigger.
24/02/2020, 15:33 - Shakey China: Unlike in the US where they are trained to pull the trigger when they see the colour black.
24/02/2020, 15:40 - Jamzig: Or if you reach for the glovebox to get your drivers license at their request
24/02/2020, 15:40 - Shakey China: Oh yeah of course, I think I heard about that one
24/02/2020, 15:42 - Shakey China: One of my American friends says that loads of people get slammed up on false charges. Like if they arrest someone and can't indict them on the arresting charge they will find another one.
24/02/2020, 15:42 - Shakey China: And the morning breathalyzer punishment is one of the worst.
24/02/2020, 15:43 - Shakey China: If you're caught drinking in public in some states the punishment is that you have to take a breathalyzer test every morning for a period of time like 3 or 6 months or even a year.
24/02/2020, 15:43 - Shakey China: And
24/02/2020, 15:43 - Shakey China: You have to pay for it.
24/02/2020, 15:44 - Shakey China: Normally 10 to 20 dollars.
24/02/2020, 15:44 - Shakey China: Every morning.
24/02/2020, 15:45 - Shakey China: And once you can't afford it they send you to jail where you are sold into the modern slave trade.
24/02/2020, 15:55 - Jamzig: How would you do that? Go to the police station every morning?
24/02/2020, 15:57 - Shakey China: Yep, that's what they have to do.
24/02/2020, 15:57 - Shakey China: I met a girl who had to do it.
24/02/2020, 15:58 - Shakey China: Have to get up early and go before work every morning.
24/02/2020, 15:59 - Shakey China: She left the US because of that.

25/02/2020, 18:40 - Shakey China: One time it drifted right out into the class and some students started putting their noses in their T-shirts.

03/03/2020, 16:43 - Shakey China: dozens*
03/03/2020, 16:43 - Shakey China: organisations*

03/03/2020, 17:57 - Shakey China: Dear completely immoral and senseless people of this disgusting organisation,
you obviously have a disturbing lack of empathy for the pain felt by other creatures on this planet. It's illegal for siblings of the human race to breed with each other, so why do you breed wolf siblings with each other? And yes, if you don't happen to know, every dog in the world is a descendant of the grey wolf, so you are literally subjugating its species with your insane practices. If your son or daughter was born with short legs and 3 fingers on each hand would you encourage him or her to breed with another person who has short legs and 3 fingers on each hand?
Also do you have any idea what kind of health problems some of these wolves you're breeding have? How would you like it if you suffered some insane breathing problems and had a funny shaped mouth because some selfish and ignorant prick like yourself wanted to have a cute toy that can move around?
I think it's time for you to wake up and get real and start doing something that's good to the world.
No more messing around with nature and creating millions of cases of unnecessary suffering.
Think about all these poor wolves that need to be 'put to sleep' because of your selfish needs.

The sh*ttest regards,

Someone who has empathy

15/03/2020, 10:33 - Jamzig: There is a line of thinking that market crashes are needed every now and then to pick out weaker companies that aren't competitive but are gaming the system in order to survive
15/03/2020, 10:34 - Jamzig: The unfortunate thing is that the poor suffer whilst rich individuals get richer during a market crash
15/03/2020, 12:36 - Shakey China: Hong Kong made it even better for the rich people buy giving every adult ¬£1,000 but not the kids. But surely the families are the ones who most need the money, right?

20/03/2020, 18:09 - Jamzig: that said... surprisingly it looks like 111 call handlers don't get paid much anyway: https://www.glassdoor.co.uk/Salaries/111-call-handler-salary-SRCH_KO0,16.htm
20/03/2020, 18:14 - Shakey China: The government needs to instate a mandatory home fitness regime with everyone at home now
20/03/2020, 18:14 - Dana: A fair bit more than me :D
20/03/2020, 18:15 - Kieran Sweden: For a big fat hug
20/03/2020, 18:15 - Jamzig: honestly Shakey people aren't taking the social distancing very seriously in some areas, it's busy as usual around here in Surrey
20/03/2020, 18:15 - Kieran Sweden: Backwards UK
20/03/2020, 18:15 - Jamzig: I even see old (maybe 70+) year olds wandering around for a stroll
20/03/2020, 18:16 - Jamzig: the entire country is on lock down for that age group and above essentially
20/03/2020, 18:16 - Shakey China: Also I would recommend a rationing system where your BMI has a direct effect on the amount of food you receive
20/03/2020, 18:17 - Shakey China: Obviously being those with a higher BMI get less food
20/03/2020, 18:18 - Jamzig: but what about muscle mass?
20/03/2020, 18:19 - Shakey China: They could use one of those scales that you put your hands on and it measures all your levels
20/03/2020, 18:19 - Shakey China: Bonus protein in the rations for more muscle mass
20/03/2020, 18:19 - Shakey China: That'll encourage people to get jacked
20/03/2020, 18:21 - Jamzig: Can you please join the Communist party and become the local mayor for your province so that I can see all of these crazy ideas put into action
20/03/2020, 18:24 - Shakey China: Haha or I could use that tiny piece of land between Egypt and Sudan that noone wants
20/03/2020, 18:24 - Shakey China: Supercity
20/03/2020, 18:24 - Shakey China: I did pretty well at that
20/03/2020, 18:24 - Shakey China: Income tax was 100% of everyone's salary
20/03/2020, 19:02 - Dana: (Media omitted)

21/03/2020, 08:04 - Jamzig: So am i
21/03/2020, 08:05 - Jamzig: What do pigeons normally eat in the wild? Bugs and worms?
21/03/2020, 08:05 - Andrew: probably anything they can get from humans
21/03/2020, 08:06 - Andrew: seagulls are more ambitious though, one stole a baguette from my hand once
21/03/2020, 08:06 - Andrew: and seagulls eat pigeons in bristol sometimes
21/03/2020, 08:07 - Jamzig: Christ
21/03/2020, 08:07 - Jamzig: Bird eat bird world out there
21/03/2020, 08:07 - Andrew: it really is savage
21/03/2020, 08:08 - Jamzig: I did have a Brighton seagull steal a donut from my mouth. He attacked from behind bounced off my shoulder and the donut was gone
21/03/2020, 08:08 - Andrew: stay safe out there x
21/03/2020, 08:08 - Jamzig: People then laughed at me
21/03/2020, 08:08 - Jamzig: Ptsd

21/03/2020, 09:17 - Jamzig: @447800771260 i'm guessing you are better now?
21/03/2020, 09:17 - Andrew: yeah better, but it's lingering and it feels like the last day or so of flu
21/03/2020, 09:19 - Jamzig: Oh dang. At least it's nearly gone though
21/03/2020, 09:23 - Niall Barber: I played the system entirely by accident
21/03/2020, 09:23 - Andrew: a likely story
21/03/2020, 09:24 - Andrew: üë®üèΩ‚Äç‚úà
21/03/2020, 12:20 - Kieran Sweden: Have I heard this one?
21/03/2020, 12:21 - Kieran Sweden: How bad did it get?
21/03/2020, 12:31 - Andrew: not as bad as flu but bad enough to bedridden for a day or so
21/03/2020, 12:45 - Kieran Sweden: Ahhh shit.  That sucks
21/03/2020, 12:45 - Kieran Sweden: Did you pass out or anything?
21/03/2020, 12:46 - Andrew: almost at one point but that was probably low blood sugar
21/03/2020, 12:46 - Andrew: hands feet and face went numb
21/03/2020, 12:46 - Andrew: body clearly ran out of fuel but threw a tantrum about it because i was fighting a virus
21/03/2020, 12:53 - Kieran Sweden: Ah right. You reckon its to do with the deliverooing you doing atm? If you are still doing that atm
21/03/2020, 12:54 - Andrew: yeah suspect so, was in about 15 restaurants overall on friday and saturday last week
21/03/2020, 12:54 - Kieran Sweden: Horee sheeet
21/03/2020, 12:55 - Kieran Sweden: Only in one yesterday. Had old people. Was a bit nervous for them
21/03/2020, 12:57 - Andrew: well, make that the last time you're close to old people for a while
21/03/2020, 13:04 - Kieran Sweden: Intit
21/03/2020, 14:03 - Jamzig: honestly if there are any old people who are ignoring government's and WHO's advise then good riddance to the,
21/03/2020, 14:03 - Jamzig: *them
21/03/2020, 14:04 - Andrew: but still you can control your own physical distancing from them and should obv still do that
21/03/2020, 14:06 - Jamzig: well yeah keep away from everyone, but at the same time if they are using public space then they are almost certainly going to catch it
21/03/2020, 14:06 - Jamzig: unless they are wearing a mask and washing their hands constantly
21/03/2020, 14:09 - Andrew: https://www.propublica.org/article/a-medical-worker-describes--terrifying-lung-failure-from-covid19-even-in-his-young-patients
21/03/2020, 14:09 - Andrew: some nightmare fuel for you all
21/03/2020, 14:16 - Jamzig: despite it being on a small minority of people who die from the disease, if you end up needing a respirator it sounds like bad news for your lungs:

'Even if you survive ARDS, although some damage can heal, it can also do long-lasting damage to the lungs. They can get filled up with scar tissue. ARDS can lead to cognitive decline. Some people‚Äôs muscles waste away, and it takes them a long time to recover once they come off the ventilator.'

22/03/2020, 18:47 - Jamzig: around Woking the supermarkets are filled by opening time
22/03/2020, 18:47 - Jamzig: no staples to be found, first it was pasta and rice, and now even potatoes
22/03/2020, 18:48 - Joe James: Its not been too bad around here luckily for me. The Aldi in particular restocks well enough.
22/03/2020, 18:48 - Joe James: Pasta and uncooked rice remain difficult to locate

22/03/2020, 18:54 - Jamzig: as there are various fungi that like to grow in cooked rice
22/03/2020, 19:01 - Joe James: Classic source of food poisoning from buffets or burrito stands

23/03/2020, 07:21 - Andrew: that was a whole 3 months ago when loo roll was plentiful and people could congregate together

23/03/2020, 10:33 - Jamzig: There's an international effort to utilize people's idol graphics cards and cpu's to collectively make a supercomputer which can accelerate research
23/03/2020, 10:34 - Jamzig: I think around 100,000 people have downloaded the software and are contributing their processing power
23/03/2020, 10:34 - Andrew: ooh interesting
23/03/2020, 10:35 - Andrew: where did you get that
23/03/2020, 10:36 - Jamzig: There's a subreddit /r/covid19 that set up a group to participate
23/03/2020, 10:37 - Jamzig: I mean people were doing it already, but the numbers have surged after that sub suggested the software
23/03/2020, 11:11 - Kieran Sweden: Maybe you could do this Niall?
23/03/2020, 11:11 - Niall Barber: Yeah shall do it today
23/03/2020, 11:12 - Kieran Sweden: Noice
23/03/2020, 11:19 - Jamzig: it's worth noting that it chews up most of your processing power, so only set it up to run when you aren't using the PC
23/03/2020, 11:20 - Niall Barber: I guess I could get it running now
23/03/2020, 11:28 - Jamzig: https://foldingathome.org/start-folding/
23/03/2020, 11:40 - Kieran Sweden: Whats the difference between make a decision and take a decision?
23/03/2020, 11:40 - Jamzig: probably something like, choose an option vs action an option
23/03/2020, 11:40 - Jamzig: unless they mean the same thing
23/03/2020, 11:41 - Jamzig: take a decision sounds weird...
23/03/2020, 11:42 - Jamzig: ok it's a thing: https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/take%20a%20decision
23/03/2020, 11:42 - Niall Barber: Take a decision sounds weird but makes sense
23/03/2020, 11:42 - Jamzig: taken the decision sounds more PROPA
23/03/2020, 11:43 - Niall Barber: I suppose they could mean different things
23/03/2020, 11:43 - Niall Barber: Iunno
23/03/2020, 12:04 - Kieran Sweden: It does. I dont recall ever using it, but to me seems like a time dependent thing
23/03/2020, 12:05 - Kieran Sweden: I would probably say made a decision in place of take
23/03/2020, 12:20 - Jamzig: ayyyy check this out: https://www.tomshardware.com/news/folding-at-home-worlds-top-supercomputers-coronavirus-covid-19
23/03/2020, 12:24 - Jamzig: the folding at home algorithm i'm running is now being run by so many people that it equates to the world's 7 fastest supercomputers combined
23/03/2020, 12:42 - Kieran Sweden: Wow. Thats nuts
23/03/2020, 12:42 - Kieran Sweden: UL says he's too lazy to run it
23/03/2020, 12:42 - Jamzig: if you need to use the computer i'd advise against it as it's using a lot of resources
23/03/2020, 12:43 - Jamzig: I dislike my landlord so I want to spike his electricity bill before I move out as well
23/03/2020, 12:48 - Kieran Sweden: During the day he does. But in the evening I dont know really
23/03/2020, 12:48 - Kieran Sweden: Its a bit difficult given the situation

23/03/2020, 21:04 - Jamzig: why 3 ?
23/03/2020, 21:04 - Andrew: that's how long these measures last
23/03/2020, 21:04 - Andrew: until they're reviewed
23/03/2020, 21:05 - Jamzig: i see
23/03/2020, 21:06 - Dana: Work won‚Äôt let me üò≠
23/03/2020, 21:06 - Jamzig: well if the enforcement of 'social distancing' proves to be working, then i can't see them repealing the legislation again
23/03/2020, 21:07 - Jamzig: that said I've been doing some reading into the mortality rates, and it's probably a lot lower than originally predicted given how many cases are going unreported
23/03/2020, 21:07 - Jamzig: doesn't help that a lot of people will still need to be hospitalised regardless which is where the real strain is
23/03/2020, 21:07 - Jamzig: what happens if you say you think you have symptoms?
23/03/2020, 21:10 - Dana: Yeah I can self isolate and get ¬£94 per week or they also let you just not come in and not get paid
23/03/2020, 21:33 - Jamzig: laaame
23/03/2020, 21:39 - Joe James: It's going to be a lot longer than 3 weeks

24/03/2020, 06:23 - Shakey China: You may only leave home ONCE a day for ONE form of exercise. So if you go jogging then you can't change to walking or you are breaking the the rules by doing more than ONE form of exercise.
24/03/2020, 06:24 - Andrew: cant really see how they would enforce just doing one per day
24/03/2020, 06:25 - Shakey China: Just don't change the form in front of PC dickhead

24/03/2020, 07:58 - Andrew: why not just let them go past
24/03/2020, 08:01 - Kieran Sweden: Just shit yourself. They wont wanna smell that
24/03/2020, 08:01 - Andrew: yeah that seems more reasonable than letting them overtake
24/03/2020, 08:03 - Jamzig: To be fair, how many police do you see on the streets these days? I doubt they will be enforcing it
24/03/2020, 08:04 - Andrew: they will most likely only fine if you're being disobedient
24/03/2020, 08:04 - Dana: Don‚Äôt know a problem in life that can‚Äôt be fixed by shitting yourself!
24/03/2020, 08:04 - Shakey China: Just go hiking in the countryside, the police aren't gonna have time to wonder the fields

24/03/2020, 08:19 - Kieran Sweden: Wait, is your job cold calling?
24/03/2020, 08:19 - Kieran Sweden: Or however its called
24/03/2020, 08:19 - Dana: Kind of, it‚Äôs calling people who signed up on our website
24/03/2020, 08:19 - Dana: Or at a uni event in which case they‚Äôre like uhhhh I signed up for the sweets sorry
24/03/2020, 08:20 - Kieran Sweden: Ohhhh, I had an offer like this. Apparently I was perfect for it.

‚ÄúAs I was pulling downwards to try and remove the magnets, they clipped on to each other and I lost my grip. And those two magnets ended up in my left nostril while the other one was in my right. At this point I ran out of magnets.‚Äù

31/03/2020, 12:08 - Niall Barber: I've had swollen throat, tight chest pain, stabbing pains in my heart and left side, confusion and fevers
31/03/2020, 12:09 - Andrew: it was less bad than flu for me personally, niall has had traumatic week

31/03/2020, 12:20 - Kieran Sweden: Oh right.
31/03/2020, 12:21 - Jamzig: the guy actually made that song because nobody believed the local government due to its level of corruption
31/03/2020, 12:21 - Jamzig: so he probably saved a lot of lives lol
31/03/2020, 12:21 - Jamzig: we need him right now for the numpties that aren't socially distancing
31/03/2020, 12:48 - Niall Barber: Just weighed myself and it looks like I've lost around 3kg

02/04/2020, 20:48 - Jamzig: I suspect the Tories will lay down a red carpet for Corbyn or the next Labour leader and force him into leadership once all of this is over

03/04/2020, 19:11 - Kieran Sweden: I be having a couple of friends over tomorrow evening unfortunately
03/04/2020, 19:12 - Kieran Sweden: Unless we incorporate everyone for this quiz
03/04/2020, 19:12 - Kieran Sweden: If thats also ok with you guys
03/04/2020, 19:12 - Dana: Gosh dang it kieran! And yes it is okay
03/04/2020, 19:13 - Niall Barber: Also Kieran, that doesn‚Äôt sound like social distancing üòÆ
03/04/2020, 19:14 - Kieran Sweden: Dope
03/04/2020, 19:15 - Kieran Sweden: Yeh, I mean we just see closest friends only. Watched Numberphile and 3blue1brown to explain some things
03/04/2020, 19:15 - Kieran Sweden: Was interesting
03/04/2020, 19:24 - Kieran Sweden: Can we test the connection beforehand to make sure it all works?
03/04/2020, 19:30 - Jamzig: Is this with Zoom?
03/04/2020, 19:30 - Dana: Niall said there‚Äôs a time limit on zoom
03/04/2020, 19:30 - Dana: Maybe google hangouts?
03/04/2020, 19:30 - Niall Barber: Yeah hangouts is the best option
03/04/2020, 19:31 - Jamzig: Also we're not zoomers
03/04/2020, 19:31 - Niall Barber: Ok zoomer
03/04/2020, 19:31 - Jamzig: Ok hangouts is good with me
03/04/2020, 19:39 - Kieran Sweden: What is the time limit on zoom?
03/04/2020, 19:39 - Dana: Something like 45 mins
03/04/2020, 19:41 - Kieran Sweden: Oh right
03/04/2020, 19:42 - Kieran Sweden: Thats shit
03/04/2020, 19:49 - Jamzig: Why is it so popular then?
03/04/2020, 19:56 - Dana: (Media omitted)
03/04/2020, 19:57 - Niall Barber: I believe it‚Äôs because it‚Äôs designed to be a meeting application which is padded out with lots of features
03/04/2020, 19:57 - Niall Barber: Whereas hangouts and Skype are more just video calling apps
03/04/2020, 19:59 - Niall Barber: Zoom does look cool but there is a 40 minute limit on the free tier and I‚Äôve heard has loads of security flaws
03/04/2020, 20:02 - Jamzig: Yeah same
03/04/2020, 20:12 - Dana: (Media omitted)
03/04/2020, 20:12 - Dana: I can hear him murmuring ‚ÄúYeah...not quite straight‚Äù

03/04/2020, 20:43 - Jamzig: I'll be free as well
03/04/2020, 20:45 - Joe James: I bought a Switch and a bunch of games. Legend of Zelda BOTW has had the lions share of game time.
03/04/2020, 20:46 - Jamzig: Oh nice
03/04/2020, 20:47 - Dana: What time is best for everyone?
03/04/2020, 20:47 - Andrew: i need to work probably from 6pm but quite loose on times really
03/04/2020, 20:49 - Joe James: 03:12am would suit me as i'll be up anyway taking a piss even though i'm really careful about drinking water in the evening and it's fucking annoying and should only happen to old people

05/04/2020, 09:20 - Kieran Sweden: Dana, your quiz was amazing. I tried this later in the evening with the others and its fair to say Greeks are not the easiest people to get to sit down and listen
05/04/2020, 09:22 - Dana: Haha it may have been a lil too English for them!
05/04/2020, 09:22 - Dana: As in too many questions about Britain

05/04/2020, 12:47 - Dana: You‚Äôre all wrong
05/04/2020, 12:48 - Dana: How is the Wednesday this week not this Wednesday
05/04/2020, 12:48 - Kieran Sweden: Contextual
05/04/2020, 12:48 - Kieran Sweden: This wednesday just gone
05/04/2020, 12:48 - Kieran Sweden: This wednesday coming up
05/04/2020, 12:48 - Kieran Sweden: So I guess both
05/04/2020, 13:19 - Jamzig: The ambiguity can easily be removed by specifiying Wednesday just gone or this coming Wednesday
05/04/2020, 13:19 - Jamzig: I guess
05/04/2020, 13:30 - Kieran Sweden: I know

06/04/2020, 11:55 - Jamzig: ;}ƒê
06/04/2020, 11:56 - Jamzig: But is it typo+ or typo- ?
06/04/2020, 13:06 - Joe James: Great joke
06/04/2020, 13:31 - Kieran Sweden: The greatest
07/04/2020, 17:59 - Dana: (Media omitted)
07/04/2020, 17:59 - Dana: An email from a stationery company
07/04/2020, 17:59 - Dana: (Media omitted)
07/04/2020, 18:08 - Jamzig: hands off!!!
08/04/2020, 15:10 - Shakey China: I just sharted on my girlfriend. Well my pants were there to save it hitting her.
08/04/2020, 15:20 - Jamzig: I'm not sure what to say to that.
08/04/2020, 15:21 - Jamzig: Next level up from performing the dutch oven on your girlfriend i suppose
08/04/2020, 15:52 - Niall Barber: Can we clarify if you did actually shart on her
08/04/2020, 16:26 - Kieran Sweden: Could you elaborate on this story
08/04/2020, 16:27 - Dana: Was it just a little skid or was it a proper expulsion of bowels?
08/04/2020, 16:28 - Dana: Was it on purpose?
08/04/2020, 16:35 - Kieran Sweden: I believe it would be. Its shakey
08/04/2020, 17:04 - Shakey China: Haha, so it was certainly on purpose. I needed to fart badly after drinking loads of blended bean milk, so I turned around to her wearing just my pants and launched a massive fart. It was like a combination between a wet fart and one of those explosive sharters. There was good 5 cm sprinkling of shit on the inside of my pants as well a one bigger piece about the size of a cubed thumb nail, so pretty bad really. I had to wipe my arse a few times to clean it up.
08/04/2020, 17:05 - Dana: But girlfriend was shielded of the Damage by the pants?
08/04/2020, 17:06 - Shakey China: Yep very luckily for her it wasn't the pair of pants with holes in it.
08/04/2020, 17:07 - Dana: Have you lined up counselling sessions for her?
08/04/2020, 17:08 - Jamzig: Oh dear god
08/04/2020, 17:08 - Jamzig: Shakey please never eat 'blended bean milk' again
08/04/2020, 17:08 - Kieran Sweden: No, please do
08/04/2020, 17:09 - Kieran Sweden: Until you get back to Europe at least
08/04/2020, 17:09 - Shakey China: I thought about sending my girlfriend to a nutritionist that supports all my dietary ideas.
08/04/2020, 17:10 - Shakey China: Then she can join in with me
08/04/2020, 17:10 - Shakey China: I have blended bean milk almost everyday
08/04/2020, 17:10 - Kieran Sweden: Maybe she can upgrade your ideas
08/04/2020, 17:11 - Shakey China: Yeah that would be good, imagine if I can find someone to compete with at farting and shitting
08/04/2020, 17:12 - Shakey China: I had a fart off with a Dutch guy in a hostel in Australia once
08/04/2020, 17:12 - Shakey China: All night long in a 12 bed dorm
08/04/2020, 17:14 - Kieran Sweden: Olympic sport
08/04/2020, 17:14 - Kieran Sweden: If their were 12 alive at the start, there certainly weren't at the end
08/04/2020, 17:22 - Shakey China: Haha I'll just never forget the look on this South African guys face in the morning
08/04/2020, 18:03 - Kieran Sweden: merka is fukd

08/04/2020, 20:10 - Jamzig: Jesus christ that means Trump is unbeatable
08/04/2020, 20:10 - Andrew: trump is blates gonna get a second term
08/04/2020, 20:11 - Andrew: unless he catastrophically handles the virus in the US
08/04/2020, 20:11 - Jamzig: Nobody will vote for Biden. He can barely form a coherent sentence. Two guys in their 70's with cognitive decline are 'Murica's choices. Wow
08/04/2020, 20:11 - Jamzig: He already is, but his fans won't see it that way
08/04/2020, 20:37 - Joe James: Trump was always getting a second term
08/04/2020, 20:37 - Joe James: Jesus Christ maybe could have given him a close run
08/04/2020, 20:37 - Joe James: Maybe.
08/04/2020, 21:58 - Kieran Sweden: Watching that Trevor Noah show has the reporter guy interviewing trump supporters. Brain cells are lacking
09/04/2020, 09:22 - Dana: Shall we do a sweepstakes on when the lockdown will be lifted
09/04/2020, 09:24 - Kieran Sweden: Sure
09/04/2020, 09:24 - Dana: I‚Äôll go 18 May
09/04/2020, 09:24 - Niall Barber: 5th June
09/04/2020, 09:28 - Kieran Sweden: 6th June
09/04/2020, 09:28 - Kieran Sweden: 1st August
09/04/2020, 09:28 - Kieran Sweden: First were a joke
09/04/2020, 09:32 - Andrew: do you think they would partially lift it?
09/04/2020, 09:33 - Andrew: some businesses reopening or perhaps no groups of more than 5?
09/04/2020, 09:34 - Andrew: or lifted but with certain gatherings banned for much longer?
09/04/2020, 09:39 - Kieran Sweden: Will probably be slow process. Just watching China. They still seem to be mostly lockdown
09/04/2020, 09:39 - Kieran Sweden: Guys here reckon Italy have gone the path of herd immunity
09/04/2020, 10:15 - Niall Barber: Isn't Italy on total lockdown?
09/04/2020, 10:26 - Kieran Sweden: Yeh, but they just seemed to get so many cases that Italy will just be immune on first wave
09/04/2020, 10:28 - Jamzig: Impossible to tell without sufficient testing
09/04/2020, 10:30 - Jamzig: Beat in mind that you can herd immunity within Italy, but if they re-open the borders and infected people start moving in then you can get a 2nd wave again
09/04/2020, 10:30 - Kieran Sweden: True. It was more of a swipe at their response
09/04/2020, 10:30 - Jamzig: *bear in mind
09/04/2020, 10:30 - Kieran Sweden: Nah, beat in mind
09/04/2020, 10:30 - Niall Barber: I think they were just unlucky enough to be the first country in Europe where there was an outbreak.
09/04/2020, 10:30 - Niall Barber: Spain seems to be on the same course
09/04/2020, 10:30 - Niall Barber: And the UK
09/04/2020, 10:30 - Jamzig: Yup we are unfortunately on the same path as Italy
09/04/2020, 10:31 - Niall Barber: I read some people were projecting at the peak, the UK would have something like 3000 deaths a day :O
09/04/2020, 10:31 - Joe James: Hysterical nonsense
09/04/2020, 10:32 - Jamzig: Is that without social isolation?
09/04/2020, 10:32 - Niall Barber: I don't believe so
09/04/2020, 10:32 - Niall Barber: We'll see though
09/04/2020, 10:32 - Jamzig: You could potentially get that if the nhs became overwhelmed and could no longer place people into icu
09/04/2020, 10:33 - Jamzig: Well Italy has had it the worse and i think they were peaking at just over 1000 deaths a day, but then us Brits are fatties...
09/04/2020, 10:33 - Jamzig: Says the only fatty in this group chat üòí
09/04/2020, 10:34 - Niall Barber: https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/apr/07/uk-will-be-europes-worst-hit-by-coronavirus-study-predicts
09/04/2020, 10:34 - Niall Barber: That's where I read it
09/04/2020, 10:34 - Niall Barber: Who knows wot will happen doe
09/04/2020, 10:35 - Niall Barber: Given that we had around 900 deaths yesteday, it doesn't that crazy to me
09/04/2020, 10:36 - Jamzig: I call bullshit on the statement: 'UK will become the country worst hit by the coronavirus pandemic in Europe, accounting for more than 40% of total deaths across the continent.'
09/04/2020, 10:37 - Jamzig: Uk is roughly 15% of the population of Europe
09/04/2020, 10:37 - Niall Barber: I would've thought France or Spain
09/04/2020, 10:38 - Niall Barber: US figures are pretty bleak as well
09/04/2020, 10:55 - Kieran Sweden: france are on fire
09/04/2020, 10:56 - Kieran Sweden: 40% seems a bit steep
09/04/2020, 11:00 - Kieran Sweden: The IHME modelling forecasts that by 4 August the UK will see a total of 66,314 deaths ‚Äì an average taken from a large estimate range of between 14,572 and 219,211 deaths, indicating the uncertainties around it.
09/04/2020, 11:00 - Kieran Sweden: yeh, take that 40% with a pinch of salt
09/04/2020, 11:00 - Kieran Sweden: nice little range they have
09/04/2020, 11:45 - Joe James: Is this quiz happening Saturday?

18/04/2020, 11:20 - Kieran Sweden: its a doozy
18/04/2020, 11:59 - Niall Barber: I'm not gonna be doing the quiz today. My symptoms came back a couple of days ago and I had a pretty rough night, so am recovering for the next few days probably. Feel free to carry on without me though üëç
18/04/2020, 12:00 - Alan: Maybe postpone til tomorrow?
18/04/2020, 12:00 - Niall Barber: Me and Dana were up all night so we're both pooped
18/04/2020, 12:00 - Niall Barber: Yeah if you guys don't mind
18/04/2020, 12:01 - Andrew: i'd be fine doing it in a weekday evening, my diary isn't exactly packed
18/04/2020, 12:03 - Jamzig: aah lame
18/04/2020, 12:04 - Jamzig: does it feel like before? or do you think you have just caught a cold?
18/04/2020, 12:04 - Jamzig: ditto
18/04/2020, 12:04 - Alan: Have you dialled 111? Lines might be less busy... Might be
18/04/2020, 12:05 - Dana: Well we called 999, ambulance came and made sure the chest pain wasn‚Äôt heart related
18/04/2020, 12:06 - Alan: Oh god did they give you a corboner test also?
18/04/2020, 12:07 - Jamzig: oh dang
18/04/2020, 12:09 - Niall Barber: It's basically the same as before. 3 days ago I had chest pain again, 2 days ago my cough came back stronger, then yesterday I had chest pain again all day but it was particularly bad in the evening. As I was going to sleep the centre of my chest really hurt and my heart started pounded really hard and fast. So decided to call 999 and was put through to a nurse who said that I should be seen. So yeah had them come over and wire me up to machines to test me out. Apparently my heart is fine, it's most the muscles around my lungs, and the lung pain which contributed to the pain in the centre of the chest
18/04/2020, 12:10 - Niall Barber: Nah no corbona test :(
18/04/2020, 12:10 - Jamzig: well if they checked you over and say your heart is fine that's good news.
18/04/2020, 12:11 - Alan: Ah makes sense, cos you weren't actually in A & E üòê
18/04/2020, 12:11 - Jamzig: could it feasibly be that your muscles have been damaged from all the coughing hence the pain?
18/04/2020, 12:11 - Jamzig: nasty place to get pains though
18/04/2020, 12:11 - Alan: Sorry to hear that, exactly same symptoms? Did you go out in public last week?
18/04/2020, 12:12 - Niall Barber: They said they are seeing a trend in people getting a rebound of the virus after they've recovered as there's still some virus left in ya
18/04/2020, 12:12 - Niall Barber: I did go out last week unfortunately, I was feeling pretty much ok at that point
18/04/2020, 12:12 - Jamzig: oh that's a ballache i didn't know this was happening
18/04/2020, 12:12 - Niall Barber: Yeah same
18/04/2020, 12:13 - Niall Barber: News to me
18/04/2020, 12:13 - Jamzig: you went for a run after you had recovered didn't you?
18/04/2020, 12:13 - Niall Barber: I think it's case by case of course. Most people seem to recover after 7-14 days
18/04/2020, 12:13 - Niall Barber: Yeah I went for 2 runs last weekend
18/04/2020, 12:14 - Niall Barber: Think the last run I had was last Friday
18/04/2020, 12:15 - Jamzig: surprising that you can be well enough to go running and then rebound. Well take it easy and make Dana fetch you lots of healthy food!
18/04/2020, 12:15 - Niall Barber: Yeah it's a weird one
18/04/2020, 12:16 - Niall Barber: Moo has mentioned having periods where he doesn't feel great
18/04/2020, 12:16 - Niall Barber: After recovery that is
18/04/2020, 12:16 - Niall Barber: One of the medics said that a lot of people are taking weeks to recover
18/04/2020, 12:17 - Andrew: I've had a headache that felt similar to my symptoms last month for the last 1-2 days
18/04/2020, 12:18 - Andrew: very subtle though and my hangover from 2 beers last night is probably causing my headache today
18/04/2020, 12:20 - +44 7751 824132: So sorry to hear all this Niall. Sounds just awful. Potato pancakes help with any illness, I know for a fact!
Feel better soon and don't be afraid to pester the doctors üôèüèª
18/04/2020, 12:21 - Dana: Haha were gonna have ‚ÄúMcDonalds‚Äù sausage n egg McMuffins and hash browns which is pretty much potato pancakes!
18/04/2020, 12:21 - +44 7751 824132: Yum!

18/04/2020, 17:32 - Dana: My only improvement would be making two thin patties instead of one thicccc for more crispiness. And also shop bought hash brown so it‚Äôs less work :D

18/04/2020, 18:14 - Shakey China: On top of my normal salary.
18/04/2020, 18:14 - Shakey China: But food wise everything is perfect.
18/04/2020, 18:15 - Shakey China: Eating beans and drinking bean milk everyday.

18/04/2020, 18:17 - Shakey China: Hahaha that gif is good
18/04/2020, 18:18 - Shakey China: The cost of being scarred for life by the smell of rotten chicken yogurt.
18/04/2020, 18:19 - Jamzig: oh yes we did a quizz recently where a question on your flatulence came up. Methane levels before and after you began drinking that bean milk:
18/04/2020, 18:19 - Jamzig: (Media omitted)
18/04/2020, 18:19 - Jamzig: actually i would assume this is after the farts had been contained to the apartment and were no longer being released into the atmosphere
18/04/2020, 18:20 - Shakey China: Hahaha
18/04/2020, 18:20 - Shakey China: Exactly
18/04/2020, 18:20 - Shakey China: I normally let them build up over an hour or so at a time under the covers during the night.
18/04/2020, 18:21 - Shakey China: And then I lift the cover to realise the deadly concoction on my girlfriend.
18/04/2020, 18:23 - Shakey China: If I wanted to I could lift the cover on the other side, but I choose to lift the part closest to her.
18/04/2020, 18:26 - Jamzig: you are a terrible person
18/04/2020, 18:27 - Shakey China: I'm actually a very kind good hearted person except for when it comes for respecting other people's sense of smell.
18/04/2020, 18:28 - Jamzig: I'd agree with that statement
18/04/2020, 18:28 - Jamzig: I would add *except when it comes to leaving human faeces in the countryside a well
18/04/2020, 18:29 - Shakey China: Hahaha I was literally about to add that
18/04/2020, 18:31 - Alan: And snowmen
18/04/2020, 18:31 - Shakey China: I'll never forget that time when I was with Tim Goodley and I had a speight of diarrhea, and I squatted right in front of him and did a projectile 2 girls 1 cup. Luckily he stood back.
18/04/2020, 18:31 - Shakey China: And yeah I have no respect for snowmen
18/04/2020, 18:32 - Jamzig: (Media omitted)
18/04/2020, 18:32 - Jamzig: so somebody ate it?
18/04/2020, 18:33 - Shakey China: Hahaha not quite but it was the same kind of projectile thing.
18/04/2020, 18:33 - Shakey China: You missed the time in Wales with Nick Finch when I shat and some dogs went to eat it.
18/04/2020, 18:34 - Shakey China: Then the dogs' owners came along and one of them said, "That's your shit is it," in a thick Welsh accent.
18/04/2020, 18:35 - Shakey China: That video is pretty good. I'll have to show that to my girlfriend.
18/04/2020, 18:54 - Kieran Sweden: I forgot about this absolute classic
18/04/2020, 20:02 - Andrew: said to myself "please don't shit on me" as a flock of seagulls flew above me just now

24/04/2020, 08:19 - Alan: He looks like he's planning a diabolical scheme. Perhaps we should call his bluff and do the opposite of what he says.
24/04/2020, 08:21 - Dana: Alan and Niall - This kind of reckless thinking is what gets you an Eastern European girlfriend
24/04/2020, 08:39 - Jamzig: Sounds like an ad i'd see on sketchy site: 'Do this everyday and the girls won't stop calling'
24/04/2020, 08:40 - Jamzig: Perhaps Trumps supporters will all follow his advise and die off üòí

03/05/2020, 16:14 - Jamzig: You talk for hours and hours to prevent some legislation being passed

04/05/2020, 15:25 - Shakey China: What can go wrong when you wipe your arse?
1. You didn't fully follow through on your last piece of shit so you end up smearing the shit all over your arse crack.
2. The shit is so wet and acidic that your finger tips go straight through the toilet paper and up your slimy arse hole.
3. After 3 or 4 wipes and encore shit starts to emerge and you have to start all over.
4. Your arse is super sore and burning because you ate too much chili the day before.
5. Your hand is super dry and can't grip the toilet paper and ends up sliding up your arse crack.
6. There is a tremendous lump of shit stuck in the hair in your arse crack and the job becomes a tremendous ordeal.
7. You stand up having not followed through on your last piece of shit and it drops into your pants on the ground.
04/05/2020, 15:30 - Jamzig: üòí
04/05/2020, 15:31 - Kieran Sweden: I imagine this happened in one sitting

04/05/2020, 15:33 - Shakey China: And good one!
04/05/2020, 15:34 - Shakey China: 9. You go for a walk after your shit and then an aftershock shit comes through.
04/05/2020, 15:36 - Dana: 10. Wiping after a period poop, I won‚Äôt elaborate

06/05/2020, 14:22 - Jamzig: Nope
06/05/2020, 14:23 - Jamzig: Well there was some woman at a train station who was fined a few weeks back
06/05/2020, 14:23 - Jamzig: I think it was because she was also giving the police shit though
06/05/2020, 16:25 - +44 7751 824132: https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/amp/health-52548843

06/05/2020, 16:28 - Shakey China: I don't know anyone who was fined. I just wonder how legitimately the police can actually fine people.
06/05/2020, 16:29 - Shakey China: Australian police must be in heaven now since the get life time boners over fining people.

06/05/2020, 17:07 - +44 7751 824132: Are you feeling any better yet?

06/05/2020, 17:30 - Niall Barber: I've really no idea tbh :P
06/05/2020, 17:31 - +44 7751 824132: Well, at least you are not dead
06/05/2020, 17:31 - Niall Barber: That's the main thing

07/05/2020, 16:12 - Shakey China: I was split seconds away from sharting about 3 hours ago.

07/05/2020, 16:15 - Jamzig: Unimpressed by his Dad's flatulence
07/05/2020, 16:17 - Shakey China: I guess it depends whether he's homeschooled or sent to public school.
07/05/2020, 16:24 - Jamzig: if he is homeschooled then the noxious gasses in your apartment will stunt his mental ability
07/05/2020, 16:24 - Jamzig: I certainly can't concentrate when i smell one of your farts
07/05/2020, 16:59 - Kieran Sweden: I think the world will be thankful this is singular

15/05/2020, 09:52 - Kieran Sweden: Also, friend might have a project coming up that she said would be paid if you guys are up for it

15/05/2020, 10:00 - Andrew: interesting
15/05/2020, 10:00 - Andrew: what's it for?
15/05/2020, 10:24 - Jamzig: Do you mean designing a website or building it? Or both?
15/05/2020, 10:53 - Kieran Sweden: I think both
15/05/2020, 10:53 - Kieran Sweden: Maybe a collaboration
15/05/2020, 10:53 - Kieran Sweden: https://pelagos-apartments.com/
15/05/2020, 10:54 - Kieran Sweden: She wants something similar to this
15/05/2020, 10:59 - Jamzig: That site doesn't work very well on mobile, scrolling seems to get stuck on certain elements
15/05/2020, 11:00 - Jamzig: Moo what do you reckon?
15/05/2020, 11:00 - Jamzig: Something you'd be interested in?
15/05/2020, 11:04 - Kieran Sweden: Ah ok. If you have some questions for her, I can forward them
15/05/2020, 11:09 - Jamzig: this site has a lot of bugs...
15/05/2020, 11:09 - Jamzig: anyway, i'll DM you
15/05/2020, 11:18 - Kieran Sweden: Okendoken
15/05/2020, 14:19 - Shakey China: It's my girlfriend's birthday
15/05/2020, 14:19 - Andrew: 10% less farts today then
15/05/2020, 14:19 - Shakey China: You mean 10% extra?
15/05/2020, 14:19 - Jamzig: what are you doing for her?
15/05/2020, 14:20 - Shakey China: Bought her some lettuce and aubergine
15/05/2020, 14:20 - Jamzig: sounds romantic
15/05/2020, 14:21 - Shakey China: Na I got her some new hiking shoes
15/05/2020, 14:21 - Shakey China: And I cooked a feast this evening
15/05/2020, 14:21 - Shakey China: Gonna take her out somewhere tomorrow
15/05/2020, 14:21 - Jamzig: ayyyy
15/05/2020, 14:21 - Jamzig: sounds nice
15/05/2020, 14:21 - Jamzig: where to?
15/05/2020, 14:22 - Shakey China: A mountain
15/05/2020, 14:22 - Shakey China: We can be romantic at the top of the mountain
15/05/2020, 14:22 - Shakey China: When we're all sweaty
15/05/2020, 14:23 - Shakey China: I should probably close today off by Dutch ovening her though
15/05/2020, 14:26 - Jamzig: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9XUNbTsVY0A
15/05/2020, 14:45 - Jamzig: so is China pretty much entirely business as usual again?
15/05/2020, 14:45 - Jamzig: are people wearing masks outside?
15/05/2020, 14:47 - Shakey China: Yeah for sure. Masks are compulsory almost everywhere
15/05/2020, 14:48 - Shakey China: Except if your office has less than 20 people in it
15/05/2020, 14:48 - Niall Barber: I wear a mask
15/05/2020, 14:48 - Niall Barber: Most people don't though
15/05/2020, 14:48 - Shakey China: Then you can take it off in the office
15/05/2020, 14:48 - Shakey China: Well yeah
15/05/2020, 14:48 - Shakey China: That's why the virus didn't spread in Asia
15/05/2020, 14:48 - Jamzig: we do have a problem in the UK with people refusing to wear masks in public
15/05/2020, 14:49 - Niall Barber: Yep, there was a video of London yesterday showing packed buses with barely anyone wearing masks
15/05/2020, 14:49 - Shakey China: The main issue is that most masks are uncomfortable as fuck around the ears
15/05/2020, 14:49 - Niall Barber: Rather have uncomfortable ears than a shitty virus
15/05/2020, 14:49 - Shakey China: Well yeah of course
15/05/2020, 14:50 - Shakey China: But in China there are comfortable ones
15/05/2020, 14:50 - Niall Barber: Ah right
15/05/2020, 14:50 - Shakey China: Very comfortable ones actually
15/05/2020, 14:50 - Niall Barber: Yeah I have to say mine is pretty uncomfortable
15/05/2020, 14:50 - Shakey China: That kinda hang on your ears in a way
15/05/2020, 14:50 - Shakey China: Well British businessmen are retards
15/05/2020, 14:51 - Shakey China: Don't have a clue what the consumer needs
15/05/2020, 14:51 - Jamzig: I'm going to assume this is probably by and large the working class who can't work from home who are on public transport
15/05/2020, 14:52 - Niall Barber: Yeah
15/05/2020, 14:52 - Niall Barber: They have no choice after the government urged people to go back to work
15/05/2020, 14:52 - Jamzig: I'd also imagine that wearing a mask is pointless unless you can get the majority of people wearing one as it can infect you through your eyes
15/05/2020, 14:52 - Jamzig: yup
15/05/2020, 14:53 - Jamzig: even a bandana around your face and some sunglasses/ glasses is better than nothing though
15/05/2020, 14:54 - Shakey China: This message was deleted
15/05/2020, 14:54 - Shakey China: Yeah it's pretty pointless unless everyone wears one
15/05/2020, 14:54 - Niall Barber: I read that as banana :P
15/05/2020, 14:55 - Shakey China: People in China use grapefruits as masks
15/05/2020, 14:55 - Jamzig: yeah mate pottasium inactivates the virus
15/05/2020, 14:55 - Niall Barber: Clearly we should be doing the same!
15/05/2020, 14:55 - Niall Barber: Nice try virus, I've got my banana üòé
15/05/2020, 14:56 - Shakey China: Potassium and magnesium in the diet will actually have a strong positive effect on your immune system
15/05/2020, 14:57 - Shakey China: And there is no doubt that your immune system plays a major role in this situation
15/05/2020, 14:57 - Jamzig: true
15/05/2020, 14:58 - Shakey China: So eat plenty of greens and beans
15/05/2020, 14:59 - Jamzig: but not too many of the latter
15/05/2020, 14:59 - Jamzig: or you will shart
15/05/2020, 14:59 - Jamzig: source: Shakey
15/05/2020, 15:00 - Shakey China: Greens will significantly enhance the smell too
15/05/2020, 15:01 - Shakey China: At least when my girlfriend and I are at the top of the mountain the fart will only rise up from there
15/05/2020, 15:26 - Jamzig: what mountain are you going up?
15/05/2020, 16:39 - Shakey China: Nanshan
15/05/2020, 16:39 - Shakey China: It's the second best known mountain in Shenzhen

21/05/2020, 10:04 - Niall Barber: It's free
21/05/2020, 10:04 - Niall Barber: Everyone can get one now
21/05/2020, 10:04 - Niall Barber: If you're over 5 years old that is
21/05/2020, 10:05 - Niall Barber: So none for Joe

21/05/2020, 10:05 - +44 7751 824132: Is it an antibody test?
21/05/2020, 10:06 - Niall Barber: Nah it's just to see if you have it
21/05/2020, 10:06 - Niall Barber: They're still working on an antibody test
21/05/2020, 10:06 - Niall Barber: I think you can buy antibody tests privately, but they're like ¬£200
21/05/2020, 10:06 - Niall Barber: And who knows how accurate
21/05/2020, 10:09 - +44 7751 824132: You are well informed mister Barber
21/05/2020, 10:09 - +44 7751 824132: Good luck with your test
21/05/2020, 10:09 - +44 7751 824132: It would be very weird if it came back negative

21/05/2020, 11:24 - Jamzig: Is it not an antibody test then?
21/05/2020, 11:25 - Jamzig: If not it may well come back negative if you have fought off the virus albeit with outstanding symptoms
21/05/2020, 11:30 - Niall Barber: The hope is that it comes back negative yeah. As far as I can tell, the antibody test hasn't been approved yet
21/05/2020, 11:31 - Niall Barber: I'd like one but I'm not paying a shit load for one that potentially might not be accurate

22/05/2020, 21:27 - +44 7751 824132: You will have to nurse it back to life Mr Bee
22/05/2020, 21:50 - Jamzig: When i find a wasp i pick it up with tweezers and put it into my venus flytrap, then watch it as it struggles and slowly gets trapped
22/05/2020, 21:50 - Jamzig: üëπ
22/05/2020, 21:50 - Jamzig: Bees are bros thougg
22/05/2020, 21:56 - +44 7751 824132: Oh James, how dare you
23/05/2020, 09:01 - Andrew: it was still on the patio this morning so i took it inside on a spoon and gave it some more sugar
23/05/2020, 09:01 - Andrew: and it flew onto one of the plants :')
23/05/2020, 09:02 - Niall Barber: Maybe he's got covid
23/05/2020, 09:02 - Andrew: he might have flew
23/05/2020, 09:02 - Andrew: ü§°
23/05/2020, 09:13 - Alan: https://www.newscientist.com/article/mg24532740-800-wasps-may-benefit-us-as-much-as-bees-could-we-learn-to-love-them/
23/05/2020, 09:14 - Alan: They may be nature's scumbags, but you should think again about mercilessly slaughtering them zig
23/05/2020, 09:16 - Alan: That article might be premium content, Niall can enjoy it
23/05/2020, 09:27 - Jamzig: To be fair there was a wasps nest in the roof of my parents place a few years back and it was left alone
23/05/2020, 09:29 - Jamzig: They don't go for you unless you get too close to the nest. Still bastards though
23/05/2020, 09:31 - Jamzig: Ok i will leave wasps alone for now. I think we can all agree to hate the hornet though
23/05/2020, 09:40 - Shakey China: Non of you lot have seen a real hornet in Japan or Korea
23/05/2020, 09:45 - Jamzig: Are they as big as a predatory bird? Do they murder entire towns when they appear?
23/05/2020, 09:46 - Jamzig: Do they sound like helicopters when they approach?
23/05/2020, 09:57 - Alan: Send in Godzilla, he'll sort em out
23/05/2020, 10:11 - Joe James: Asian Giant Hornet. They kill people in south-east Asia countries every year and are a great reason to never visit there or indeed ever go outside again https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=EZ1eAM8CChc
23/05/2020, 10:17 - Alan: Why didn't the film makers step in and help the bees?
23/05/2020, 10:17 - Alan: That was grim
23/05/2020, 10:21 - Joe James: Yes i'd forgotten just quite how unsettling it is
23/05/2020, 10:32 - Kieran Sweden: For fun or food?
23/05/2020, 10:32 - Kieran Sweden: Cant they just smother the Hornets into an inferno?
23/05/2020, 10:36 - Jamzig: https://youtu.be/fdAqre8X3hI
23/05/2020, 10:36 - Jamzig: We need a man like this to deal with the hornet nests
23/05/2020, 10:38 - Kieran Sweden: What the hell
23/05/2020, 10:49 - Shakey China: Also the Asian Giant Hornet is native to East Asia, not Southeast Asia
23/05/2020, 10:50 - Shakey China: Last time I checked, Japan and Korea were not located in Southeast Asia
23/05/2020, 10:51 - Shakey China: https://youtu.be/3P8svtzTRuI
23/05/2020, 10:52 - Shakey China: Asian bees know how to deal with the bitches
23/05/2020, 11:00 - Jamzig: Oh yeah i've seen this before
23/05/2020, 11:03 - Jamzig: I wander whether there's been any attempts to cross breed Asian and European bees
23/05/2020, 11:03 - Jamzig: I just found out that there are a category of male bees called drones in a bee colony who's only job is to go around mating with female bees
23/05/2020, 11:04 - Jamzig: Ayyyyy what a job
23/05/2020, 11:07 - Kieran Sweden: far east asia
23/05/2020, 11:30 - Joe James: European and African honey bees were successfully bred to produce Africanized bees, also known as 'killer bees' https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Africanized_bee
23/05/2020, 11:42 - Jamzig: they sound aggressive
23/05/2020, 11:43 - Jamzig: 'They can chase a person a quarter of a mile (400 m); they have killed some 1,000 humans, with victims receiving ten times more stings than from European honey bees'
23/05/2020, 11:43 - Jamzig: fuck being chased 400 metres by a swarm of bees
23/05/2020, 12:09 - Shakey China: Male wasps and hornets also only mate with the queen and then die
23/05/2020, 12:09 - Shakey China: I think the queen normally kills them after mating
23/05/2020, 12:10 - Shakey China: Certainly doesn't make sex such a pleasurable experience
23/05/2020, 12:10 - Shakey China: At least for the guys
23/05/2020, 12:55 - Andrew: the beee stayed inside this morning and i just opened a window and it flew outside
23/05/2020, 12:55 - Andrew: glad I helped the bee population
23/05/2020, 12:56 - Jamzig: Was it a bee or wasp?
23/05/2020, 12:56 - Andrew: i think it was actually a bee
23/05/2020, 12:57 - Andrew: it didn't have thick black attenae
23/05/2020, 12:57 - Niall Barber: It identifies as a wasp
23/05/2020, 12:58 - Andrew: it had a striped bottom section but the yellow was fairly dull compared to a wasp
23/05/2020, 12:58 - +44 7751 824132: (Media omitted)
23/05/2020, 12:58 - +44 7751 824132: We have a new mate also

25/05/2020, 17:23 - Kieran Sweden: For some reason, this song reminds me of jojo
25/05/2020, 18:47 - Jamzig: Ok!
25/05/2020, 20:15 - Joe James: Probably because we spent a car journey to Bristol doing exactly that
25/05/2020, 20:17 - Joe James: God that photo of Moo in his Jesus years
25/05/2020, 20:18 - Joe James: I feel it's only fair we post a photo of Niall from his school days too

25/05/2020, 22:16 - Niall Barber: That was taken last year I fink
26/05/2020, 15:22 - Dana: https://twitter.com/benthetim/status/1265195409242234881?s=21 Michel Gove is such a joker
26/05/2020, 15:22 - Jamzig: Ahaha what a name! Chairman lmao
26/05/2020, 15:22 - Jamzig: Hahaha
26/05/2020, 15:22 - Jamzig: That's made my day regardless of the content
26/05/2020, 15:25 - Jamzig: So he claims he isn't a good driver and therefore it's ok for him to drive while his eyes aren't working. What sort of dirt does Cummings have on all of these Tories?
26/05/2020, 15:26 - Dana: Haha that is the question. Brexit dirt? Perhaps!
26/05/2020, 15:26 - Jamzig: Perhaps he used his pals at Cambridge Analytica to find out all of the Tory MP's porn search history
26/05/2020, 15:27 - Jamzig: Next we'll find out that a specsavers has been built at that castle in Durham
26/05/2020, 17:44 - Jamzig: The 1st president of Zimbabwe was called president Banana. It was illegal for the countries press to make fun of his name. They could be locked up without a peel.

26/05/2020, 18:21 - Joe James: Lol

26/05/2020, 23:01 - Jamzig: So... why slurpy cumcum?
27/05/2020, 07:18 - Alan: We played a jackbox game like cards against humanity. That was one of Niall's top answers
27/05/2020, 07:19 - Alan: How's Saturday's quiz coming along Zig?
27/05/2020, 12:06 - Jamzig: I have a few ideas for categories

27/05/2020, 12:14 - +44 7751 824132: No pressure
27/05/2020, 12:16 - Jamzig: What were the categories? (So i don't repeat anything)
27/05/2020, 12:16 - +44 7751 824132: History and geography

27/05/2020, 12:17 - +44 7751 824132: Bristol also
27/05/2020, 12:17 - Jamzig: That's a harsh topic for anyone who lives outside of Bristol
27/05/2020, 12:18 - Jamzig: But noted
27/05/2020, 12:20 - +44 7751 824132: Better than a topic about a place no one ever heard of
27/05/2020, 12:20 - +44 7751 824132: ü•∫
27/05/2020, 12:21 - Alan: Stravabardard happens to be my 3rd favourite island in the North Sea üòê
27/05/2020, 12:25 - Jamzig: Ok i'm going to choose a category about an obscure island

30/05/2020, 12:19 - Dana: They‚Äôre just incredibly large so the perspective is skewed
30/05/2020, 12:40 - Alan: Cow herd immunity
30/05/2020, 12:41 - Jamzig: there's only 1 bovine in this picture

30/05/2020, 17:45 - Jamzig: üëåvery nice
31/05/2020, 14:01 - Shakey China: God damn it, so when a male hornet mates with a queen, it literally explodes its entire internal genitalia into queen and obviously dies pretty quick after. Only one orgasm per life. It'd better be worth dying for.
31/05/2020, 14:01 - Shakey China: into the queen*
31/05/2020, 14:19 - Jamzig: Holy shit

31/05/2020, 14:25 - Jamzig: oh shit
31/05/2020, 14:26 - Jamzig: i need to hunt them down in a bee suit and kill them all
31/05/2020, 14:26 - Shakey China: They can sting through bee suits
31/05/2020, 14:26 - Shakey China: Good luck with that
31/05/2020, 14:26 - Shakey China: They're conquered the west coast of North America so far
31/05/2020, 14:26 - Shakey China: They've *
31/05/2020, 14:27 - Jamzig: oh shit

31/05/2020, 14:28 - Shakey China: Near Coleman's Hatch
31/05/2020, 14:28 - Jamzig: (Media omitted)
31/05/2020, 14:28 - Shakey China: Yeah that might be wise
31/05/2020, 14:29 - Shakey China: That'll be a double win in term of fighting against the hornets and coronavirus
31/05/2020, 14:31 - Shakey China: So queen ants apparently remove their wings after finding a nest spot
31/05/2020, 14:31 - Shakey China: I would wanna keep such things
31/05/2020, 14:32 - Shakey China: Must be amazing being able to fly
31/05/2020, 14:36 - Jamzig: all you need to do is step onto an airplane
01/06/2020, 12:40 - Alan: Funny moment yesterday playing jackbox with Ruta's family when a random stranger picked up our game and joined. One of the questions was 'something you wish to avoid' and one of us wrote his name. He then left
01/06/2020, 12:41 - Alan: Should we feel bad? He was probably just lonely and wanting to join in but it felt super creepy at the time lol
01/06/2020, 12:42 - Niall Barber: Haha is there not a way to do a private stream?
01/06/2020, 12:42 - Niall Barber: How did he even find it?
01/06/2020, 12:43 - Alan: You'd think so but I couldn't see the option. The twitch site is very public
01/06/2020, 12:43 - Alan: It ties the game you're playing to the stream so can just search that
01/06/2020, 12:44 - Dana: Awwww Poot guy :D
01/06/2020, 12:44 - Dana: Poor
01/06/2020, 12:45 - Alan: You say that but I bet we would have been harsher. One of his answers was really weird and homophobic so there üòõ
01/06/2020, 12:46 - Dana: Oh okay fair dos :D
01/06/2020, 12:46 - Alan: I voted for it...
01/06/2020, 12:46 - +44 7751 824132: It was very creepy üò≥
01/06/2020, 12:46 - Dana: Bahaha but really the most surprising thing here is that R≈´ta‚Äôs fam speak good enough English to play, mine could never
01/06/2020, 12:55 - Alan: The siblings have all moved internationally
01/06/2020, 12:57 - Dana: I seeeeeeeeee
01/06/2020, 13:29 - Niall Barber: What was his answer??
01/06/2020, 13:39 - Alan: Something about gays and a square peg
01/06/2020, 13:41 - Niall Barber: I wonder what people would think about our answers if they dropped in on Saturday :P
01/06/2020, 13:42 - Niall Barber: Are yours the same with Ruta's family?
01/06/2020, 13:51 - Jamzig: What was his name?
01/06/2020, 13:51 - Jamzig: Try and find the guy/girl and ask them to play again
01/06/2020, 13:53 - +44 7751 824132: EthanB
01/06/2020, 13:53 - +44 7751 824132: ü§î
01/06/2020, 13:54 - +44 7751 824132: Not as naughty as you lot
01/06/2020, 14:06 - Jamzig: I know him
01/06/2020, 14:12 - +44 7751 824132: Was it you James?
01/06/2020, 14:16 - Jamzig: Nooo
01/06/2020, 14:16 - Jamzig: It was Niall
01/06/2020, 14:20 - Niall Barber: Shhhhhhh
01/06/2020, 14:21 - Jamzig: I watched the 1st 2 episodes of Jeffrey Epstein filthy rich
01/06/2020, 14:21 - Jamzig: Holy shit he's a piece of work
01/06/2020, 14:21 - Niall Barber: Oh yeah me and Dana watched that
01/06/2020, 14:21 - Jamzig: Bit what about his 'girlfriend' ?
01/06/2020, 14:22 - Niall Barber: Unbelievable the shit he got away with
01/06/2020, 14:22 - Jamzig: Where the fuck is she?
01/06/2020, 14:22 - Niall Barber: She's just denies everything!
01/06/2020, 14:22 - Niall Barber: She's in hiding I think
01/06/2020, 14:22 - Jamzig: No spoilers
01/06/2020, 14:22 - Niall Barber: Just like Prince Andrew, she won't be able to leave the house now
01/06/2020, 14:22 - Jamzig: True
01/06/2020, 14:23 - Niall Barber: I initially wasn't going to watch it because I thought I knew about it all. But there's so much stuff that's uncovered
01/06/2020, 14:23 - Niall Barber: Great recommendation Balan üëçüèª
01/06/2020, 14:23 - Niall Barber: And Ruta
01/06/2020, 14:23 - Niall Barber: I forget which one actually recommended :P
01/06/2020, 14:34 - +44 7751 824132: We both enjoyed watching it
01/06/2020, 14:34 - +44 7751 824132: In a way where you live hating someone really badly
01/06/2020, 15:10 - Jamzig: Yeah it's an insane documentary
01/06/2020, 15:11 - Jamzig: I'm disturbed to see Steven 'one in the stink two in the' Pinker in photos with Epstein
01/06/2020, 15:11 - Jamzig: Need to investigate his connection with him
01/06/2020, 15:11 - Andrew: noooo not pinker!
01/06/2020, 15:14 - Andrew: i'm skimming an article on pinker and epstein now
01/06/2020, 15:15 - Andrew: there's a photo of lawrence krauss and epstein and pinker lol not a good look at all
01/06/2020, 15:15 - Jamzig: Also the stockholm syndrome is confusing. I know it exists and it can be quite common in sexual abuse victims, but it's difficult to empathise with given how abuse was happening
01/06/2020, 15:16 - Jamzig: With the exception of anybody on his island who was literally a prisoner
01/06/2020, 15:17 - Jamzig: Yeah they're going to have to give a lot of background to clear their names, especially after seeing how public the information of Epstein's paedophilia and grooming were all over the news for years
01/06/2020, 15:17 - Andrew: a tweet from pinker:

"I have no relationship with Epstein & have taken no funding from him. Our circles have occasionally overlapped: In 02, my lit agent invited me to join a group of east-coast TED speakers Epstein flew to CA. In 14, Krauss seated me next to him at a lunch, & someone snapped a photo."
01/06/2020, 15:18 - Jamzig: Actually on second thoughts, there's a huge difference between the adolescent brain and an adult brain in how you reason.
01/06/2020, 15:18 - Andrew: i doubt pinker's aloof personality is going to make this easy for him
01/06/2020, 15:19 - Dana: Yeah I was gonna say, these were kids coming from abusive or poor backgrounds, easy to be persuaded
01/06/2020, 15:21 - Jamzig: It still surprises me how some of them reasoned that going back to him when they knew what would happen was the sensible choice. But then it seems common for many grooming victims such as the various grooming gangs primarily in the north of England
01/06/2020, 15:22 - Jamzig: (Media omitted)
01/06/2020, 15:23 - Andrew: he's looking a lot younger there, but with perpetually grey hair
01/06/2020, 15:23 - +44 7751 824132: https://www.facebook.com/10513336322/posts/10159165215836323/?sfnsn=scwshmo&extid=4FG3TvvPE2qYbhV9
01/06/2020, 15:24 - +44 7751 824132: This was an interesting article. Just shows you how easy it is persuade young people. Especially those who are poor
01/06/2020, 15:25 - Dana: I think it‚Äôs the same kind of shitty situation as when kids join gangs in America
01/06/2020, 15:25 - Andrew: pinker apparently said of epstein:

"I found him to be a kibitzer and a dilettante -- he would abruptly change the subject, ADD-style, dismiss an observation with an adolescent wisecrack and privilege his own intuitions over systematic data."
01/06/2020, 15:25 - +44 7751 824132: Or UK
01/06/2020, 15:26 - Andrew: i think pinker's getting cancelled
01/06/2020, 15:33 - Jamzig: well that article has convinced me to avoid Croydon lol
01/06/2020, 15:33 - Andrew: you didn't avoid it already?
01/06/2020, 15:34 - Jamzig: I would travel via the tram through Croydon when i was relying on trains
01/06/2020, 15:34 - Jamzig: and met up with a guy who lives there for some freaking awesome Caribbean food once in a blue moon
01/06/2020, 15:34 - Jamzig: guy I used to work with
01/06/2020, 15:35 - Jamzig: He should go on Rogan's podcast and Rogan should bring it up to clear the air
01/06/2020, 15:35 - Jamzig: before cancel culture finds him
01/06/2020, 15:35 - Andrew: rogan just agrees with every guest anyway
01/06/2020, 15:36 - Jamzig: he does, because he's always high
01/06/2020, 15:36 - Andrew: he was on it a year or two ago I think
01/06/2020, 15:36 - Andrew: haha
01/06/2020, 15:36 - Andrew: unrelated but, my favourite ever comment on a joe rogan podcast was

"does dmt make you bald?"
01/06/2020, 15:37 - Jamzig: was that something Joe said?
01/06/2020, 15:37 - Andrew: well he perpetually mentions dmt
01/06/2020, 15:37 - Andrew: and is bald
01/06/2020, 15:38 - Jamzig: nobody watches the Joe Rogan podcast to listen to Joe, they watch it because Joe lets the guest speak without interrupting them
01/06/2020, 15:38 - Andrew: and then interjects asking them if they've ever hunted wild elk
01/06/2020, 15:38 - Jamzig: haha yeah
01/06/2020, 15:38 - Jamzig: i miss listening to Sam Harris' podcast
01/06/2020, 15:39 - Jamzig: i'm too much of a tight arse to pay
01/06/2020, 15:39 - Jamzig: joint account anyone?
01/06/2020, 15:39 - Andrew: e-mail them and they'll give you a free subscription üëç
01/06/2020, 15:39 - Andrew: gave me mine for free
01/06/2020, 15:39 - Jamzig: oh right
01/06/2020, 15:40 - Jamzig: they gave you a subscription because you're an left leaning hippy atheist
01/06/2020, 15:40 - Jamzig: after you begged
01/06/2020, 15:40 - Jamzig: and you told them that you would never read Vox news
01/06/2020, 16:02 - Andrew: nah m8 give me breitbart or give me death
01/06/2020, 16:02 - Jamzig: Ayyyyo
01/06/2020, 17:41 - Alan: This made me laugh a lot
01/06/2020, 17:43 - Alan: Not heard much news following the documentary which is surprising. Epstein must have had a lot of dirt on people I'm surprised he didn't just take em all down
01/06/2020, 17:45 - Jamzig: yeah it's insane how much he must have threatened prosecutors and victims, even as high up as the US Attorney's in order to keep them silent
02/06/2020, 08:23 - Niall Barber: I think the interesting thing in the doc is it makes clear how shady he was to get the money he got
02/06/2020, 08:24 - Niall Barber: For the longest time I was thinking how the hell did he get so much money
02/06/2020, 08:35 - Alan: "I've heard it's egg shaped, not my words. Like thicker at the bottom and then thinner like an egg, not my words"
02/06/2020, 08:37 - Niall Barber: ....again, not my words
02/06/2020, 08:37 - Niall Barber: He smirked his way through that deposition
02/06/2020, 14:23 - Dana: (Media omitted)
02/06/2020, 14:24 - Andrew: DOMINATION
02/06/2020, 14:31 - Dana: I like how he says ‚Äúno problems‚Äù and ‚Äúmany arrests‚Äù one after the other...
02/06/2020, 14:38 - Andrew: trump's tweet just reads like someone doing a parody of a trump tweet
02/06/2020, 14:38 - +44 7751 824132: Thanking himself in a third person ü§¶üèª‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è
02/06/2020, 14:39 - +44 7751 824132: Omg yes! You are spot on.
I always have to double check if it's not a joke
02/06/2020, 14:43 - Dana: He‚Äôs such a waste of sperm

03/06/2020, 07:41 - Alan: Did your face do this ü§ë when you invented it?
03/06/2020, 09:12 - Jamzig: Do you end up in one of theseüë®‚Äçü¶Ω after using it?

04/06/2020, 09:35 - Jamzig: Problem is some guy walked straight into the middle of the stream

05/06/2020, 16:28 - Alan: "And it seems to mer, yoa lived yo life, like a Kevin in the wind..."
05/06/2020, 16:35 - Andrew: his fur is like the clouds of a gas giant
05/06/2020, 16:35 - Andrew: eternally hiding the surface
05/06/2020, 16:36 - Andrew: the surface is probably hundreds of kilometres down
05/06/2020, 16:36 - Alan: If Kevin's a true gas giant he doesn't have a surface
05/06/2020, 16:37 - Andrew: a metallic core then
05/06/2020, 16:37 - Alan: Nope not even that
05/06/2020, 16:38 - Alan: Just gas and maybe some liquid in there
05/06/2020, 16:38 - Andrew: haha i was about to type "im probably wrong"
05/06/2020, 16:38 - Andrew: thanks for putting me in my place
05/06/2020, 16:38 - Andrew: i deserved it really
05/06/2020, 16:38 - Alan: Can't have you making up things about Kevin

07/06/2020, 15:44 - Andrew: they went and pulled it down!
07/06/2020, 15:44 - Niall Barber: I know!
07/06/2020, 15:44 - Andrew: that is amazing
07/06/2020, 15:45 - Andrew: didn't think that would happen tbh
07/06/2020, 15:45 - Niall Barber: I think in hindsight it makes sense
07/06/2020, 15:45 - Niall Barber: But still surprising
07/06/2020, 15:45 - Andrew: i'm really shocked
07/06/2020, 15:46 - Alan: Next they'll be renaming Blackboy Road in Exeter
07/06/2020, 15:46 - Andrew: i'm in my house recovering from the virus and this all happens

07/06/2020, 15:46 - Andrew: there's a hill in bristol called blackboy hill
07/06/2020, 15:46 - Niall Barber: Yep
07/06/2020, 15:47 - Niall Barber: Came right off
07/06/2020, 15:47 - Niall Barber: Next, Colston hall!
07/06/2020, 16:03 - Jamzig: Hmm
07/06/2020, 16:04 - Jamzig: If they want to be thorough they should burn down all of the schools that he founded as well
07/06/2020, 16:04 - Andrew: and cross out the street names
07/06/2020, 16:05 - Andrew: although that's easy
07/06/2020, 16:05 - Andrew: the statue itself has been controversial for decades and there's been petitions against it for a while ago
07/06/2020, 16:05 - Jamzig: So this guy was a slave trader? But has a statue erected because he founded a lot of schools in the area?
07/06/2020, 16:06 - Andrew: there was often little effigies of dead slaves encircling it
07/06/2020, 16:06 - Niall Barber: Yeah I found one in a bush last year
07/06/2020, 16:06 - Andrew: made his money selling slaves and used a lot of it for good
07/06/2020, 16:06 - Alan: Bristol was the slave trade hub of the empire for centuries and anyone who lives there is a massive racist profiting from it
07/06/2020, 16:07 - Niall Barber: Shit
07/06/2020, 16:07 - Andrew: damn
07/06/2020, 16:07 - Niall Barber: Guess I'm a racist now
07/06/2020, 16:07 - Andrew: most of bristol was built by slaves anyway

07/06/2020, 16:12 - Niall Barber: R stands for racist in this case
07/06/2020, 16:12 - Jamzig: oh nice. I've not been keeping up with the news but it looks like the anarchists are trying to start riots in London

07/06/2020, 16:30 - Dana: Trump had to fuck up real bad to fuck up that election
07/06/2020, 16:31 - Jamzig: Joe 'Alzheimers' Biden
07/06/2020, 16:31 - Dana: Would love to think that it‚Äôs the end of him but last time I thought I knew what was gonna happen, Brexit happened
07/06/2020, 16:31 - Jamzig: real strong opposition
07/06/2020, 16:31 - Niall Barber: Trump's nicknames are outstanding
07/06/2020, 16:31 - Niall Barber: So creative
07/06/2020, 16:31 - Niall Barber: Like the do-nothing democrats
07/06/2020, 16:31 - Alan: Joe 'videos in Epstein's safe' Biden
07/06/2020, 16:32 - Niall Barber: He's likely forgot who Epstein is
07/06/2020, 16:33 - Alan: I actually think Sleepy Joe is a great nickname, so childish
07/06/2020, 16:34 - Niall Barber: It does sound like it's from a nursery rhyme

07/06/2020, 16:53 - Alan: Guess who's paying to pull it out again?
07/06/2020, 16:54 - Niall Barber: Muggins 'ere
07/06/2020, 16:56 - Andrew: i can't really see it going back on its plinth though
07/06/2020, 16:56 - Alan: Oh no, but it'll cost the council god knows how much to pull it out now
07/06/2020, 16:59 - Dana: (Media omitted)
07/06/2020, 16:59 - Andrew: joe what do you think about all this? your silence is deafening
07/06/2020, 17:00 - Niall Barber: His silence speaks volumes
07/06/2020, 17:00 - Alan: White silence = White violence

07/06/2020, 17:16 - Andrew: i earn less than the lowest tax limit anyway üòÑ üò¢
07/06/2020, 17:17 - Andrew: ah wait yeah council tax
07/06/2020, 17:17 - Alan: Quick moo cycle down and photo the culprits so they get fined
07/06/2020, 17:17 - Andrew: well i was considering going for a walk
07/06/2020, 17:18 - Jamzig: This is why i avoid twitter
07/06/2020, 17:19 - Jamzig: So i guess now that the statue is gone all of the racists will leave Bristol now, all 3 of them
07/06/2020, 17:19 - Alan: Occasionally I go on trump's twitter to read the comments. Always instant regret
07/06/2020, 18:29 - Jamzig: Is anybody else slightly concerned that these UK protests are comparing US racism and UK racism as like for like?

Apparently slogans from the blacklivesmatter protests were used by protestors in London like 'don't shoot, don't shoot' at unarmed police officers. What?

There's an article published in the Independent which talks about US black victims of police brutality and then tried to draw comparisons with UK police with some article about tazer usage by police and an admittedly horrible story about a black british woman who had mental illness who was killed whilst in police custody (but the police officer was prosecuted and punished)
https://www.independent.co.uk/voices/george-floyd-racism-police-brutality-black-white-trump-a9541911.html
07/06/2020, 18:31 - Jamzig: I mean the UK seems to have some level of racism today, it seems to me that it's probably more equally distributed towards White Eastern Europeans, Asians as well as Black people, but making out that the problem is as widespread and systemic as it is in the US is bollocks
07/06/2020, 18:35 - Jamzig: after a brief bit of research it seems to me that in terms of police brutality (assuming that is the sole reason for these protests) there are certainly some cases of black or minority groups being killed whilst in police custody which were closed without proper investigation, but there are people also pointing to statistics of black guys being killed by police who were objectively a threat to the police/ public at the time, as in they were armed, or had already attacked people, and equating that to unjustified brutality and the result of police racism. There seems to be a lack of nuance,
07/06/2020, 18:35 - Jamzig: Then again I have been looking on twitter, so perhaps not the best of the opinions out there
07/06/2020, 18:36 - Alan: The leave.eu campaign was nothing less than racist and the British public lapped it up
07/06/2020, 18:37 - Alan: Blacks 9x more likely to be stopped and searched by police (dunno whether that's due to police patrolling shite parts of London where they live, however)
07/06/2020, 18:38 - Alan: Get off twatter it's full of opinionated idiots
07/06/2020, 18:41 - Alan: I think it's all just as systemic but that the US is a more dangerous society as a whole due to their gun control, hence more violence by and towards police
07/06/2020, 18:52 - Alan: Moo, you're from a BAME background. What are your thoughts?
07/06/2020, 19:20 - Andrew: im doing some recon in town
07/06/2020, 19:20 - Andrew: and ill write up a report
07/06/2020, 19:21 - Andrew: can see the police horses going back in their trailers
07/06/2020, 19:21 - Andrew: yep moo is on the scene, it could kick off any moment
07/06/2020, 19:23 - Alan: Don't get tasered!
07/06/2020, 19:27 - Andrew: (Media omitted)
07/06/2020, 19:29 - Jamzig: is that your tag Moo? you do produce a lot of it from your hair udders
07/06/2020, 19:30 - Alan: More council tax
07/06/2020, 19:32 - Jamzig: unless 'cash rules everything around me' from Wu Tang Clan
07/06/2020, 19:32 - Jamzig: in which case i agree with this statement, including the council tax that will pay for the graffiti removal
07/06/2020, 19:34 - Andrew: (Media omitted)
07/06/2020, 19:35 - Alan: Did they just leave all their signs on the floor?
07/06/2020, 19:35 - Jamzig: I would disagree. It seems that right wing racists are widespread in the US police force, whereas there have been efforts to penalize UK officers for racism, even when the fear of being labelled racist has impeded investigations due to the ethnicity of perpetrators.
07/06/2020, 19:36 - Jamzig: @447800771260 can you please get a close up of the signs?
07/06/2020, 19:36 - Andrew: (Media omitted)
07/06/2020, 19:36 - Jamzig: I'm genuinely curious what is written on them
07/06/2020, 19:36 - Andrew: ahead of ya
07/06/2020, 19:36 - Jamzig: nice. Thanks
07/06/2020, 19:36 - Jamzig: 'white silence is violence' - tells me everything I need to know about the people there
07/06/2020, 19:37 - Jamzig: *compliance
07/06/2020, 19:37 - Jamzig: but wait... 'if ur racist suck ur mum' I can get on board with this

07/06/2020, 19:42 - Alan: Saw a guy in the park with an acoustic guitar the other day
07/06/2020, 19:43 - Niall Barber: Are there any police there?
07/06/2020, 19:43 - Andrew: yeah some
07/06/2020, 19:43 - Andrew: about 10 guarding the war memorial
07/06/2020, 19:43 - Niall Barber: Lol
07/06/2020, 19:44 - Niall Barber: Just in case
07/06/2020, 19:44 - Alan: Only pikeys attack war memorials - for scrap metal
07/06/2020, 19:44 - Alan: Happened in Lingfield
07/06/2020, 19:45 - Alan: Reckon Colston will appear again at low tide?
07/06/2020, 19:46 - Alan: Covered in sea weed
07/06/2020, 19:46 - Niall Barber: Shouting racist slurs
07/06/2020, 19:46 - Niall Barber: It‚Äôs in a pretty awkward place to retrieve I think
07/06/2020, 19:57 - Jamzig: actually a final resting place at sea is quite symbolic of all the slaves who died whilst in voyage I guess
07/06/2020, 20:00 - Alan: I think for the first time I've ever been on there the negative comments on trump's twitter outweigh supportive ones
07/06/2020, 20:23 - Jamzig: https://tuckbot.tv/#/watch/gyi6ch
07/06/2020, 20:23 - Jamzig: lets oppose racism by throwing shit at the police and chasing them out of the street
07/06/2020, 20:35 - Jamzig: (Media omitted)
07/06/2020, 20:39 - Jamzig: here's a good one:
07/06/2020, 20:39 - Jamzig: (Media omitted)
07/06/2020, 20:40 - Jamzig: 'In 1903, when Gandhi was in South Africa, he wrote that white people there should be "the predominating race." He also said black people "are troublesome, very dirty and live like animals."'
07/06/2020, 20:40 - Jamzig: Looks like Ghandi isn't the saint they think he is
07/06/2020, 20:41 - Jamzig: *Gandhi
07/06/2020, 20:43 - Alan: https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/magazine-29701767
07/06/2020, 20:44 - Alan: Ghandi was a misogynistic cunt as well yet is his statue getting defaced
07/06/2020, 20:45 - Jamzig: oh I know he was an arsehole
07/06/2020, 20:46 - Jamzig: but defacing Churchill's statue isn't going to help the movements public image. You know how people love Churchill regardless of his track record
07/06/2020, 20:48 - Alan: Don't think they actually have a plan..
07/06/2020, 20:51 - Jamzig: which leads to the question: shouldn't they be tearing down nearly all the statues across UK cities? most of them probably were oppressors/bigots/racists by modern standards
07/06/2020, 20:52 - Jamzig: I'd like to ask the protesters. What are your demands? also is it just black people that matter? no other minority groups? because that's the impression I'm getting.
07/06/2020, 20:56 - Alan: I predict A level students will be studying how this all fizzled out after a few weeks from lack of direction and lack of support from the general public. Maybe it'll contribute to the fall of trump who knows
07/06/2020, 20:57 - Alan: Just look at the 2011 London riots and fuck all happened after that
07/06/2020, 20:58 - Jamzig: oh i'm fully for the blacklivesmatter protests in America because they have legitimate grievances with completely complacent leaders, but the UK version is just a bit of a joke so far.
07/06/2020, 20:58 - Jamzig: true
07/06/2020, 21:06 - Jamzig: next level virtue signalling

07/06/2020, 21:23 - Jamzig: anyway I'm going to remove my head from twitters colon and wipe myself down. Won't be venturing in there again for a while

09/06/2020, 15:54 - Kieran Sweden: Always answer with a question
09/06/2020, 16:16 - Andrew: https://www.indy100.com/article/boris-johnson-racist-keir-starmer-pmqs-george-floyd-black-lives-matter-9546586
09/06/2020, 16:25 - Jamzig: Oh skweezy you...
09/06/2020, 16:27 - Jamzig: "His somewhat dismissive tone when saying "of course black lives matter" has made people question whether he genuinely understands the gravity of the issue, despite his claim that as a white, upper-class, middle-aged man he "totally gets it" (he does not; he¬†can¬†not"
09/06/2020, 16:27 - Jamzig: I love this paradox. You are a white man so you can't possibly understand a minority groups struggles.
09/06/2020, 16:28 - Jamzig: But you must listen to us and understand us
09/06/2020, 16:28 - Jamzig: Which is it?
09/06/2020, 16:30 - Dana: Much like my experience with mathematics, you must strive to understand it but because you yourself are not mathematics you will never understand it fully and it‚Äôs best to acknowledge that
09/06/2020, 16:30 - Jamzig: All the evidence of Boris's racism is pretty damning though
09/06/2020, 16:33 - Jamzig: Good analogy, but the difference is often that it's claimed that you *cannot* understand it, with the implication that attempting to empathise is a waste of time and you should therefore follow their advice without scrutiny
09/06/2020, 16:34 - Jamzig: It's a bad way to start a dialogue
09/06/2020, 16:36 - Dana: I don‚Äôt know that that‚Äôs the implication, I think it‚Äôs more so, because of their unique experience they are best placed to give advice. Much like why women‚Äôs health care has been lacking because the vast majority of doctors were men
09/06/2020, 16:44 - Jamzig: I agree that they would be best placed to give advice, but part of resolving an issue is the ability to understand what the grievances are, and how to address that. That's constructive. Perhaps i'm reading into that phrase too deeply, but i've often seen articles written in a preachy manner implying that the conversation cannot be had because a white man will *never* understand.

So how do you move forward with that information?
09/06/2020, 16:47 - Jamzig: As for women's healthcare. Agreed, i've heard feminists recently bring up the issue of car safety which is designed to protect the body of the average man, and less so women. There was a constructive discussion about how the tolerances for injury are too high and so engineers should rethink how they approach safety.

They weren't saying, as a woman you will never know how dangerous a car is to us, and you'll never understand, so you should change x y z.
09/06/2020, 16:50 - Dana: I can only judge that one article, I think they were taking issue with ‚Äúof course BLM‚Äù because well, not of course because look at the things you‚Äôve said in the past; and ‚ÄúI totally get that‚Äù no you don‚Äôt and you can‚Äôt. I think it‚Äôs just a combo of a leftie article and Boris phrasing things poorly (and being a general wanker)
09/06/2020, 16:52 - Dana: Yeah the comparison wasn‚Äôt well thought out :D
09/06/2020, 16:57 - Jamzig: Not that i like the guy, i hate Boris, but i do also wander whether he could ever say/do anything to change people's minds to show that he wants to take action to reduce racial inequality.
09/06/2020, 16:58 - Andrew: The person that wrote is clearly anti-Johnson and its not literally true that he‚Äôs unable to ‚Äútotally get‚Äù an issue like this, but I think realistically the chance of Boris totally empathising and acting like it is practically zero
09/06/2020, 16:58 - Dana: I think a good place to start would be to do things and then talk about them
09/06/2020, 16:58 - Jamzig: Perhaps his actions could improve his standing, but a lot of the time once you have said something unpleasant and it's permanently online you reputation is tarnished as irredeemably a racist/bigot etc..
09/06/2020, 16:59 - Jamzig: Actually i do somewhat agree. I doubt Johnson will make much of an effort
09/06/2020, 16:59 - Andrew: conversationally I think saying that Bojo cannot understand the issue is fine
09/06/2020, 17:00 - Andrew: not because he's white, middle-aged, upper-class, tory, more because he is boris johnson :P
09/06/2020, 17:01 - Andrew: thought the article would induced more of a "ha ha boris racist" kind of convo ü§°
09/06/2020, 17:01 - Jamzig: That's not what was said:
 'despite his claim that as a white, upper-class, middle-aged man he "totally gets it" (he does not; he¬†can¬†not).'
09/06/2020, 17:02 - Andrew: but yes it's not true that he literally is incapable of understanding it ever
09/06/2020, 17:02 - Andrew: oh so said he gets it because he is those things?
09/06/2020, 17:02 - Dana: I think it is true :D
09/06/2020, 17:02 - Andrew: or despite his claims, whilst he is those things, but hadn't mentioned?
09/06/2020, 17:03 - Andrew: yes me too, but we're going for scientific accuracy here üë©üèº‚Äçüî¨
09/06/2020, 17:03 - Jamzig: No my point is that (and i've seen this elsewhere in other articles) that being white and also being rich or powerful especially means that you have cannot empathise. Richard Dawkins would certainly fall into that category and he's not exactly a white supremacist
09/06/2020, 17:05 - Jamzig: I'll find an article which sums up what i see as the typical 'white people don't understand racism' viewpoint
09/06/2020, 17:05 - Andrew: yeah no i've seen that sentiment in articles recently
09/06/2020, 17:07 - Andrew: in this case I read it more as that boris johnson said he gets it BECAUSE he is white middle-aged upperclass, which is barmy, and if someone said that then they're probably too far gone
09/06/2020, 17:08 - Andrew: but that's a misreading
09/06/2020, 17:10 - Jamzig: Ehhh perhaps. I'll tell you what i'll make a concerted effort to see where the idea of 'white people don't understand racism' is coming from and whether there are merits to the argument
09/06/2020, 17:33 - Dana: I think the nuance there is between cannot empathise and cannot fully empathise, I think we can empathise and understand to an extent but not fully, I don‚Äôt know if the articles mean it the first or second way
09/06/2020, 17:45 - Alan: As a black man trapped inside a white man's body I feel that I can empathise fully.
09/06/2020, 17:45 - +44 7751 824132: I especially enjoy his black cock
09/06/2020, 17:59 - Kieran Sweden: Knew it mon

10/06/2020, 17:42 - Kieran Sweden: prolly shoulda shut down earlier
10/06/2020, 17:42 - Kieran Sweden: ooo...whats that
10/06/2020, 17:43 - Alan: Neil 'friends with benefits' Ferguson also said half the amount of deaths if we'd shut down a week earlier
10/06/2020, 17:44 - Kieran Sweden: shoulda coulda woulda
10/06/2020, 17:45 - Alan: They knew they shoulda at the time
10/06/2020, 17:48 - Alan: Are Sweden thinking to implement any sort of lockdown or has that ship sailed?
10/06/2020, 17:49 - Kieran Sweden: think the ship has sailed
10/06/2020, 17:49 - Kieran Sweden: I mean, we still have crowds of less than 50
10/06/2020, 17:49 - Kieran Sweden: which is why protests in Gothenburg got shut down
10/06/2020, 17:50 - Jamzig: Enforcing that would be interesting...
10/06/2020, 17:50 - Kieran Sweden: and that people who are asymptomatic can travel freely within Sweden after 15th June
10/06/2020, 17:50 - Kieran Sweden: most reason is to do with Midsummer on 21st I reckon
10/06/2020, 17:51 - Jamzig: Are people wearing masks outside?

10/06/2020, 17:52 - Kieran Sweden: perhaps I should
10/06/2020, 17:52 - Andrew: i see quite a few wearing them here in bristol
10/06/2020, 17:52 - Andrew: but overall not many
10/06/2020, 17:56 - Niall Barber: Yeah more and more people are wearing them up here
10/06/2020, 17:56 - Niall Barber: Still most people aren‚Äôt, but there‚Äôs way more than say last month
10/06/2020, 17:57 - Alan: Will be mandatory on tfl from 15th June
10/06/2020, 17:57 - Niall Barber: That seems like it should‚Äôve already been in place
10/06/2020, 17:57 - Alan: Why it wasn't 2 months ago no one knows
10/06/2020, 17:57 - Alan: Maybe the ppe shortage panic
10/06/2020, 17:58 - Jamzig: But they had the brilliant plan of reducing public transport to dissuade people from using it and totally not forcing everyone into even more crowdes spaces
10/06/2020, 17:59 - Niall Barber: My managers wife had to wear a make-shift hazmat suit in late March because they ran out of ppe

10/06/2020, 18:00 - Niall Barber: Isn‚Äôt London doing bizarrely better than most of the country in terms of infection?
10/06/2020, 18:08 - Alan: I think everyone hates one another more here so it's easier to avoid contact
10/06/2020, 18:08 - Alan: That and more hospitals + way less commuters
10/06/2020, 18:12 - Alan: London had it bad at the start though, first to peak so now first over the peak
10/06/2020, 18:20 - Jamzig: If anyone gets near Alan he pulls out his caged rat and sets it on them
